history: |
  Puerto Rican Baked Ziti represents the beautiful fusion that happens when Italian-American
  cooking meets Caribbean flavors. Puerto Rico's long history with both Spanish colonization
  and American influence created a unique culinary identity that embraces adaptation.

  The key Puerto Rican elements that transform this dish are:
  - **Sazón**: A seasoning blend with annatto (achiote) that gives food its characteristic
    golden-orange color and subtle earthy flavor
  - **Adobo**: The all-purpose Puerto Rican seasoning of garlic, oregano, and other spices
  - **Sofrito**: The aromatic base of onions, peppers, garlic, cilantro, and culantro that
    forms the foundation of Puerto Rican cooking

  This dish is common at family gatherings, holidays, and potlucks throughout Puerto Rican
  communities, both on the island and in the mainland US diaspora.

sofrito_note: |
  Sofrito is the "secret" behind Puerto Rican cooking. Every family has their own recipe, but
  it typically includes:
  - Ají dulce (sweet peppers) or cubanelle
  - Onion and garlic
  - Cilantro and culantro (recao)
  - Sometimes tomato

  Blend everything together and freeze in ice cube trays for easy use.

serving_suggestions:
  - "Serve with tostones (fried plantains) on the side"
  - "Accompany with a simple lettuce and tomato salad"
  - "Pair with rice and beans for a complete Puerto Rican feast"
  - "Serve with hot sauce (pique) on the side"

make_ahead: |
  Assemble up to 24 hours ahead and refrigerate. Add 15 minutes to covered baking time. The
  sofrito and sazón flavors actually deepen overnight. Freezes well unbaked for up to 3 months.

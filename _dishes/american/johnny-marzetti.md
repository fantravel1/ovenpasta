## Columbus, Ohio's Culinary Gift

In 1896, **Teresa Marzetti** created this hearty pasta dish at her restaurant near Ohio State University. Named for her brother-in-law Johnny, it cost just 45 cents per serving—perfect for hungry college students.

The dish became so popular that Teresa went on to found the Marzetti Company, which still makes salad dressings and croutons today.

## Global Spread

Here's the remarkable part: American soldiers brought Johnny Marzetti to **Panama** during World War II, where it became "Johnny Mazetti"—now considered the **national dish of Panama**.

## What Makes It Different

Johnny Marzetti uses **cheddar cheese** (not Italian cheeses like mozzarella or Parmesan). This distinctly American choice sets it apart from Italian-American baked pastas.

## Ingredients

### Meat Sauce
- 450g ground beef
- 1 large onion, diced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 cans (400g each) tomato sauce
- 1 can (400g) diced tomatoes
- 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- Salt and pepper

### Pasta & Cheese
- 350g elbow macaroni
- 350g sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (divided)
- Fresh parsley for garnish

## Instructions

### Make the Meat Sauce

1. **Brown beef**: In a large skillet, cook ground beef over medium-high heat until no longer pink. Drain excess fat.

2. **Add vegetables**: Add onion and bell pepper. Cook until softened, about 5 minutes.

3. **Add garlic**: Cook 1 minute until fragrant.

4. **Add tomatoes**: Stir in tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, Italian seasoning, and sugar. Season with salt and pepper.

5. **Simmer**: Cook 15-20 minutes until slightly thickened.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (175°C).

2. **Cook pasta**: Boil macaroni until al dente. Drain.

3. **Combine**: In a large bowl, mix pasta, meat sauce, and 2/3 of the cheddar cheese.

4. **Transfer**: Pour into a greased 9x13 baking dish.

5. **Top**: Sprinkle remaining cheddar over the top.

6. **Bake**: 30-35 minutes until cheese is melted and edges are bubbling.

7. **Rest**: Let stand 5 minutes. Garnish with parsley.

## The Ohio State Connection

To this day, Johnny Marzetti remains a staple in Ohio homes, particularly around Ohio State University. It appears at tailgates, potlucks, and family dinners across the state.

## Variations

### School Cafeteria Style
Many Ohioans remember a simpler version from school lunches—just beef, macaroni, tomato sauce, and cheese. No peppers, no frills.

### With Mushrooms
Add a can of sliced mushrooms to the meat sauce.

### Spicy Version
Add red pepper flakes or diced jalapeños.

## From Ohio to Panama

During WWII, American soldiers stationed in Panama introduced the dish to locals. The Panamanians embraced it, adapting it slightly and renaming it "Johnny Mazetti." Today, it's served at celebrations and family gatherings throughout Panama.

## The Ultimate Indulgence

Lobster Mac and Cheese is where New England's two great culinary traditions meet—fresh Maine lobster and creamy baked macaroni. This is special occasion food, worth every penny and every calorie.

## The Key Principles

1. **"Never skimp on the lobster"**
2. **Use claw and knuckle meat** (more flavorful than tail)
3. **Sweet, mild cheeses** that complement rather than overwhelm
4. **Keep lobster chunks large and visible**

## Ingredients

### Lobster
- 450-700g (1-1½ lbs) cooked lobster meat
- Claw and knuckle meat preferred
- 2 tablespoons butter for sautéing

### Cheese Sauce
- 450g cavatappi or shell pasta
- 75g butter
- 60g flour
- 750ml whole milk
- 250ml heavy cream
- 200g Gruyère, shredded
- 150g white cheddar, shredded
- 75g Parmesan, grated
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- Pinch of cayenne
- Salt and white pepper

### Panko Topping
- 100g panko breadcrumbs
- 45g butter, melted
- 2 tablespoons fresh chives, minced
- Pinch of paprika

## Instructions

### Prepare the Lobster

1. **Chop lobster**: Cut into large, bite-sized pieces (keep them chunky).

2. **Quick sauté**: Melt butter in a pan, gently warm lobster pieces for 1-2 minutes. Don't overcook—they'll cook more in the oven. Set aside.

### Make the Sauce

1. **Cook pasta**: Boil until 2 minutes shy of al dente. Drain.

2. **Make roux**: Melt butter in a large saucepan. Whisk in flour, cook 2 minutes.

3. **Add dairy**: Gradually whisk in milk and cream. Cook until thickened, about 10 minutes.

4. **Add cheese**: Off heat, stir in Gruyère, cheddar, and half the Parmesan. Add mustard and cayenne. Season.

5. **Combine**: Gently fold in pasta and 2/3 of the lobster.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Transfer**: Pour into a buttered 9x13 baking dish.

3. **Top with lobster**: Arrange remaining lobster pieces visibly on top.

4. **Make topping**: Toss panko with melted butter, chives, and paprika. Sprinkle over dish, then add remaining Parmesan.

5. **Bake**: 25-30 minutes until golden and bubbling.

6. **Rest**: Let stand 5 minutes before serving.

## Why These Cheeses?

| Cheese | Role |
|--------|------|
| **Gruyère** | Nutty sweetness, excellent melt |
| **White Cheddar** | Sharp but not overpowering |
| **Parmesan** | Umami, crispy top |

Avoid very sharp or pungent cheeses—they'll mask the delicate lobster.

## Wine Pairing

**Champagne** pairs "extraordinarily" well—the acidity and bubbles cut through the richness.

Also excellent:
- Burgundy Chardonnay
- Chablis
- Sonoma Chardonnay
- Sancerre

## Lobster Tips

- **Buy cooked**: Most fish markets sell pre-cooked lobster meat
- **Steam your own**: 1¼ lb lobsters yield about 4 oz meat each
- **Frozen works**: Thaw overnight in refrigerator

## When to Serve

- Valentine's Day
- Anniversary dinners
- New Year's Eve
- Any time you want to feel fancy

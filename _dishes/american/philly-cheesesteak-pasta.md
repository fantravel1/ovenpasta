## Philadelphia's Sandwich, Transformed

The **Philly Cheesesteak** was invented in 1930 by **Pat Olivieri** in South Philadelphia. Surprisingly, the original had NO cheese—that was added in 1952. This pasta captures everything Philadelphians love about their sandwich.

## Authentic Cheese Options

1. **Provolone** (original cheese addition)
2. **Cheez Whiz** (more "Philly" according to locals)
3. **American cheese**

For this pasta, we use a combination for maximum flavor and meltiness.

## Pro Tip

**Cook the pasta in beef broth** instead of water—instant flavor infusion throughout.

## Ingredients

### Cheesesteak Filling
- 500g ribeye or sirloin, thinly sliced (or ground beef)
- 2 medium onions, sliced
- 2 green bell peppers, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- Salt and pepper
- Vegetable oil

### Cheese Sauce
- 225g cream cheese
- 120g Cheez Whiz (or 150g provolone, chopped)
- 250ml milk
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder

### Pasta & Topping
- 450g penne or rigatoni
- 1 liter beef broth (for cooking pasta)
- 200g provolone, sliced
- 100g mozzarella, shredded
- Fresh parsley

## Instructions

### Cook the Filling

1. **Sear beef**: In a hot skillet, cook sliced beef in batches until browned. Remove.

2. **Cook vegetables**: Add oil, cook onions and peppers until soft and caramelized.

3. **Add garlic**: Cook 1 minute.

4. **Combine**: Return beef, add Worcestershire. Season well.

### Make Cheese Sauce

1. **Melt cheeses**: In a saucepan over low heat, combine cream cheese, Cheez Whiz, milk, and garlic powder.

2. **Stir**: Whisk until smooth and pourable.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (175°C).

2. **Cook pasta**: Boil in beef broth until al dente. Drain (save broth for soup!).

3. **Combine**: Toss pasta with beef mixture and cheese sauce.

4. **Transfer**: Pour into baking dish.

5. **Top**: Layer provolone slices, sprinkle mozzarella.

6. **Bake**: 25-30 minutes until cheese is melted and golden.

7. **Garnish**: Fresh parsley.

## The Cheez Whiz Debate

In Philadelphia, Cheez Whiz is NOT a cheap substitute—it's an authentic option with passionate defenders. Pat's and Geno's (rival cheesesteak shops) both offer it. Don't be a cheese snob.

## "Wit or Wit'out"

In Philly, you order cheesesteaks "wit" or "wit'out" onions. This pasta is definitely "wit."

## Variations

### With Mushrooms
Add 200g sautéed mushrooms—a popular cheesesteak topping.

### Spicy
Add pickled cherry peppers or banana peppers.

### Chicken Philly
Substitute chicken breast for beef.

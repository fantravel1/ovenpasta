## Why "Million Dollar"?

This isn't just baked spaghetti—it's baked spaghetti that's been to finishing school. The name comes from the indulgent cream cheese layer hidden between pasta and meat sauce, plus the five-cheese combination that makes every bite feel luxurious.

## The Five-Cheese Combination

1. **Cream cheese** (the star)
2. **Ricotta** (creaminess)
3. **Sour cream** (tang)
4. **Mozzarella** (stretch)
5. **Parmesan** (sharpness)

## Ingredients

### Meat Sauce
- 450g ground beef
- 450g Italian sausage (removed from casing)
- 1 large onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 700g marinara sauce
- 400g crushed tomatoes
- 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
- Salt and pepper

### Cream Cheese Layer
- 225g cream cheese, softened
- 250g ricotta
- 120ml sour cream
- 2 green onions, sliced
- Salt and pepper

### Pasta & Topping
- 450g spaghetti
- 250g mozzarella, shredded
- 50g Parmesan, grated
- Fresh basil for garnish

## Instructions

### Make the Meat Sauce

1. **Brown meats**: Cook ground beef and sausage in a large skillet, breaking up as it cooks. Drain excess fat.

2. **Add aromatics**: Add onion, cook until soft. Add garlic, cook 1 minute.

3. **Add tomatoes**: Stir in marinara, crushed tomatoes, and Italian seasoning. Simmer 15 minutes. Season.

### Make the Cream Cheese Layer

1. **Beat cream cheese**: Using a mixer, beat cream cheese until smooth.

2. **Add remaining**: Mix in ricotta, sour cream, and green onions. Season.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (175°C).

2. **Cook pasta**: Boil spaghetti until al dente. Drain.

3. **First layer**: Spread half the meat sauce in a 9x13 baking dish.

4. **Add pasta**: Layer half the cooked spaghetti over sauce.

5. **Cream cheese layer**: Spread ALL of the cream cheese mixture over spaghetti.

6. **Second pasta layer**: Add remaining spaghetti.

7. **Top with sauce**: Spread remaining meat sauce over pasta.

8. **Add cheese**: Sprinkle mozzarella and Parmesan over top.

9. **Bake**: 30-35 minutes until cheese is melted and edges bubble.

10. **Rest**: Let stand 10 minutes. Garnish with basil.

## The Secret Is the Layer

When you cut into Million Dollar Spaghetti, you'll see:
- Top: Bubbly cheese
- Below: Meat sauce
- Below: Pasta
- **Hidden treasure: Cream cheese layer**
- Below: More pasta
- Bottom: Meat sauce

This hidden layer of creamy goodness is what earns the "million dollar" name.

## Tips for Success

- **Soften cream cheese fully**: Beat until no lumps remain
- **Spread cream cheese layer carefully**: Don't mix with pasta
- **Let it rest**: The layers set better after resting

## Variations

### Lighter Version
- Use low-fat cream cheese and ricotta
- Use turkey instead of beef

### Vegetarian
- Replace meat with 2 lbs sautéed mushrooms and eggplant

## Make-Ahead

- Assemble completely, cover, refrigerate up to 24 hours
- Add 15 minutes to baking time if cold
- Freezes well for 3 months

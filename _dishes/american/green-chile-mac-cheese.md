## Hatch Chile Country

**Hatch Valley** in New Mexico is the "Chile Capital of the World." Every fall, the scent of roasting chiles fills the air as locals prepare their annual supply.

The official state question of New Mexico: **"Red or green?"** (referring to chile preference). Chile is the state vegetable, and roasting green chiles is the official state aroma.

## The Star Ingredient

**Hatch green chiles** are mild to medium heat with a distinctive earthy, slightly sweet flavor. Season runs July-October for fresh roasted. Canned Hatch chiles work year-round.

7. **Transfer**: Pour into buttered 9x13 dish.

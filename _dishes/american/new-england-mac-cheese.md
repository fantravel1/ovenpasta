## New England Simplicity

Where Southern mac and cheese celebrates abundance with multiple cheeses and rich custard, New England takes the opposite approach: **quality over quantity**. One excellent cheese, a simple béchamel, and always—always—a breadcrumb topping.

## The Vermont Connection

**Cabot sharp white cheddar** is the gold standard. This Vermont cooperative has been making cheese since 1919, and their extra-sharp white cheddar is what many New Englanders consider the only proper cheese for mac and cheese.

## Ingredients

### Cheese Sauce
- 500g elbow macaroni
- 75g butter
- 60g all-purpose flour
- 1 liter whole milk, warmed
- 450g sharp Vermont white cheddar, shredded
- 1 teaspoon dry mustard
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- Salt and white pepper

### Breadcrumb Topping
- 100g fresh breadcrumbs (or panko)
- 30g butter, melted
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, minced (optional)

## Instructions

### Make the Sauce

1. **Cook pasta**: Boil macaroni until 2 minutes shy of al dente. Drain, set aside.

2. **Make roux**: Melt butter in a large saucepan. Whisk in flour, cook 2 minutes.

3. **Add milk**: Gradually pour in warm milk, whisking constantly. Cook until thickened, about 8-10 minutes.

4. **Add cheese**: Remove from heat. Stir in cheddar until melted. Add mustard, cayenne, salt, and pepper.

5. **Combine**: Fold in pasta.

### Assemble and Bake

1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (175°C).

2. **Transfer**: Pour into a buttered 9x13 baking dish.

3. **Make topping**: Toss breadcrumbs with melted butter and parsley.

4. **Top**: Spread breadcrumb mixture evenly over pasta.

5. **Bake**: 25-30 minutes until golden and bubbling.

## The Breadcrumb Requirement

In New England, mac and cheese without a breadcrumb topping is considered incomplete. The crunch provides essential texture contrast to the creamy pasta below.

## New England vs. Southern

| New England | Southern |
|-------------|----------|
| Single cheese (white cheddar) | Multiple cheeses (5-6) |
| Béchamel-based | Custard-based (eggs) |
| Always breadcrumbs | Rarely breadcrumbs |
| Creamy, saucy | Firm, sliceable |
| Practical simplicity | Rich abundance |

## Wine Pairing

- Chardonnay (unoaked or lightly oaked)
- Riesling
- Hard cider (very New England)

## Make-Ahead

- Assemble without breadcrumbs, refrigerate overnight
- Add breadcrumbs just before baking
- Add 10 minutes to baking time if cold

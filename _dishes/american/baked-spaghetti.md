## America's Potluck Favorite

Baked Spaghetti appears in church cookbooks from coast to coast—the kind handed down through generations with handwritten notes in the margins. It's lasagna's simpler, more approachable cousin.

## Ingredients

- 450g spaghetti
- 450g ground beef
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 700g marinara sauce
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 250g mozzarella, shredded
- 50g Parmesan, grated
- Salt and pepper
- Fresh basil (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven** to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Cook spaghetti** until al dente. Drain.

3. **Brown beef**: Cook with onion until no longer pink. Drain fat.

4. **Add sauce**: Stir in marinara and Italian seasoning. Simmer 5 minutes.

5. **Combine**: Toss pasta with meat sauce.

6. **Assemble**: Transfer to 9x13 baking dish. Top with mozzarella and Parmesan.

7. **Bake**: 25-30 minutes until cheese is bubbly and golden.

8. **Garnish** with fresh basil.

## Why It Works

Sometimes simple is best. No fussy layering, no making béchamel—just pasta, meat sauce, and cheese, baked until bubbly.

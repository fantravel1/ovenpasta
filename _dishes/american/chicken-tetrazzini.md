## The Florentine Nightingale

**Luisa Tetrazzini** (1871-1940) was one of the most celebrated sopranos of her era, known as "The Florentine Nightingale" for her coloratura voice. When she toured America in the early 1900s, chefs competed to honor her with dishes.

As food critic **Craig Claiborne** wrote: "Although the proper name Tetrazzini is Italian in origin, the dish is about as American as Waldorf salad."

## Disputed Origins

Two hotels claim credit:
- **Palace Hotel, San Francisco** (where Tetrazzini performed her famous free Christmas concert in 1910)
- **Knickerbocker Hotel, New York** (where she stayed during East Coast tours)

The truth is lost to history, but the dish endures.

## Ingredients

### Pasta & Protein
- 450g spaghetti or linguine
- 600g cooked chicken, shredded (rotisserie works well)
- 250g fresh mushrooms, sliced

### Sherry Cream Sauce
- 75g butter
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 60g flour
- 500ml chicken broth
- 500ml heavy cream
- 120ml dry sherry (or white wine)
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme
- Salt and white pepper

### Topping
- 150g Parmesan cheese, grated
- 100g breadcrumbs
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- Fresh parsley

## Instructions

### Make the Sauce

1. **Sauté mushrooms**: Melt half the butter in a large pan over high heat. Cook mushrooms until golden. Remove.

2. **Cook aromatics**: Add remaining butter, cook onion until soft. Add garlic.

3. **Make roux**: Stir in flour, cook 2 minutes.

4. **Add liquids**: Gradually whisk in broth, cream, and sherry.

5. **Simmer**: Cook until thickened, about 10 minutes. Add thyme, season well.

6. **Add chicken and mushrooms**: Fold in shredded chicken and sautéed mushrooms.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Cook pasta**: Boil spaghetti until just al dente. Drain.

3. **Combine**: Toss pasta with sauce. Transfer to a 9x13 baking dish.

4. **Make topping**: Mix Parmesan, breadcrumbs, and melted butter.

5. **Top**: Spread breadcrumb mixture over pasta.

6. **Bake**: 25-30 minutes until golden and bubbling.

7. **Garnish**: Fresh parsley before serving.

## The Sherry Factor

Dry sherry gives Tetrazzini its distinctive flavor—don't skip it. If you must substitute, use dry white wine, but the dish won't be quite authentic.

## Variations

### Turkey Tetrazzini
The classic day-after-Thanksgiving use for leftover turkey. Simply substitute turkey for chicken.

### Seafood Tetrazzini
Replace chicken with shrimp and crab for an elegant variation.

## Wine Pairing

- Chardonnay (oaked)
- Dry Sherry (Fino or Manzanilla)
- Viognier

## Make-Ahead

- Prepare through assembly, refrigerate up to 24 hours
- Add breadcrumb topping before baking
- The flavors actually improve overnight

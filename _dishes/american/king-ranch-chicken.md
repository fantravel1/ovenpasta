## The Mystery of the Name

**King Ranch** in Kingsville, Texas is the largest ranch in the United States—over 800,000 acres. But here's the thing: the ranch has **NO connection** to this recipe. The dish apparently borrowed the prestigious name for marketing appeal.

First documented in 1966 in the San Antonio Light newspaper, King Ranch Chicken has become one of Texas's most beloved comfort foods.

## Lady Bird's Endorsement

**Lady Bird Johnson** served King Ranch Chicken at the LBJ Ranch in 1973, cementing its status as a Texas classic.

## Non-Negotiables

- **Corn tortillas** (never flour)
- **Ro-Tel tomatoes** with chiles
- **Layered construction** (not mixed)

## Ingredients

### Chicken Layer
- 1 rotisserie chicken, shredded (about 4 cups)
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons butter

### Sauce
- 1 can (10.5 oz) cream of mushroom soup
- 1 can (10.5 oz) cream of chicken soup
- 1 can (10 oz) Ro-Tel tomatoes with green chiles
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- Salt and pepper

### Assembly
- 12 corn tortillas, quartered
- 3 cups sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
- Fresh cilantro for garnish

## Instructions

### Prepare Components

1. **Sauté vegetables**: Melt butter in a pan. Cook onion, bell pepper, and garlic until softened.

2. **Make sauce**: Whisk together both soups, Ro-Tel, chicken broth, cumin, and chili powder.

3. **Combine chicken**: Mix shredded chicken with sautéed vegetables.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (175°C).

2. **Grease dish**: Spray a 9x13 baking dish with cooking spray.

3. **First layer**:
   - Spread small amount of sauce on bottom
   - Layer tortilla quarters
   - Add 1/3 of chicken mixture
   - Add 1/3 of sauce
   - Sprinkle 1/3 of cheese

4. **Repeat**: Two more complete layers.

5. **Bake**: 35-40 minutes until bubbling and cheese is golden.

6. **Rest**: Let stand 10 minutes before serving.

7. **Garnish**: Fresh cilantro.

## The Ro-Tel Factor

**Ro-Tel** (diced tomatoes with green chiles) is essential. This Texas pantry staple, created in 1943, provides the distinctive Tex-Mex kick. Don't substitute plain diced tomatoes—it won't be the same.

## Serving Suggestions

- Serve with Mexican rice
- Top with sour cream and guacamole
- Accompany with refried beans
- Garnish with pickled jalapeños

## Variations

### Lighter Version
- Use Greek yogurt instead of one can of soup
- Add more Ro-Tel, less cheese

### Spicier Version
- Use "Hot" Ro-Tel
- Add diced jalapeños
- Increase chili powder

## Make-Ahead

- Assemble completely, refrigerate up to 24 hours before baking
- Add 10-15 minutes to baking time if cold
- Freezes well for up to 3 months

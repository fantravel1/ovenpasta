# Ingredients
ingredients:
  - "1 lb elbow macaroni"
  - "4 tbsp unsalted butter"
  - "3 large eggs"
  - "12 oz evaporated milk"
  - "1 cup heavy cream"
  - "2 cups sharp cheddar, freshly shredded"
  - "1 cup mild cheddar, freshly shredded"
  - "1 cup Colby Jack, freshly shredded"
  - "4 oz cream cheese, softened"

  - "¼ tsp cayenne pepper"
  - "Salt and black pepper to taste"
  - "Butter pats for top"

# Instructions
instructions:
  - "Preheat oven to 350°F/175°C. Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish."
  - "Cook macaroni in well-salted water until just past al dente (about 2 minutes LONGER than package time). The pasta should be soft—it won't absorb as much liquid in the custard."
  - "Drain pasta and immediately toss with 4 tbsp butter while still hot."
  - "In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, evaporated milk, and heavy cream until smooth."
  - "Add cream cheese and Velveeta to the warm pasta, stirring until melted and incorporated."
  - "Add the smoked paprika, mustard powder, garlic powder, cayenne, salt, and pepper to the egg mixture."
  - "Reserve 1 cup of shredded cheese for the top. Add remaining cheeses to the pasta and stir well."
  - "Pour the egg-milk mixture over the pasta and stir to combine everything evenly."
  - "Transfer to prepared baking dish. Top with reserved cheese and dot with butter pats."
  - "Bake uncovered for 35-45 minutes until the top is golden and the custard is set (it should jiggle slightly in the center)."
  - "REST 15-20 MINUTES before serving. This allows the custard to fully set for sliceable portions."

## The Soul Food Essential

Southern baked mac and cheese is fundamentally different from the creamy, roux-based versions found in restaurants. The secret? **A custard base** made with eggs and evaporated milk that sets firm enough to slice into squares.

This isn't just comfort food—it's culture. Church suppers, Sunday dinners, Thanksgiving tables, and Juneteenth celebrations all feature this dish. As the saying goes, it's "only trusted to aunties with big upper arms."

## The History

**James Hemings** (1765-1801), the enslaved chef to Thomas Jefferson, introduced mac and cheese to America. Trained in French cuisine in Paris from 1784-1789, he served "macaroni pie" at state dinners, including the famous 1790 Dinner Table Bargain where Hamilton and Jefferson negotiated the nation's debt.

The dish evolved through African American culinary traditions into the custard-based soul food version we know today—distinct from its European ancestors.

## Custard vs. Béchamel: What's the Difference?

| Feature | Southern/Soul Food | Northern/Restaurant |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Base | Custard (eggs + evaporated milk) | Béchamel (roux-based) |
| Texture | Firm, sliceable | Creamy, saucy |
| Cheese | 4-6 varieties | Usually 1-2 |
| Pre-shredded cheese | NEVER | Sometimes acceptable |

## The Science Behind the Technique

### Why Evaporated Milk?

Evaporated milk has a **higher protein content** than regular milk, which:
- Prevents graininess in the custard
- Creates smoother texture
- Provides richer flavor without added fat

### Why Eggs?

The eggs serve dual purposes:
- **Whites** provide structure—they set into a firm custard
- **Yolks** prevent greasiness and add richness

### Why Cook Pasta Longer?

Unlike Italian baked pasta where you undercook, Southern mac and cheese uses pasta cooked **2 minutes LONGER than al dente**. Already-soft pasta absorbs less liquid from the custard, preventing a soggy texture.

## The Cheese Blend

A proper Southern mac and cheese uses **5-6 cheeses**:

1. **Sharp cheddar** — The flavor foundation
2. **Mild cheddar** — Mellows the sharp bite
3. **Colby Jack** — Smooth melting
4. **American/Velveeta** — Creaminess and melt stability
5. **Cream cheese** — Tangy richness
6. **Mozzarella** (optional) — Stretch factor

**Critical rule**: NEVER use pre-shredded cheese. The anti-caking agents prevent proper melting and create a grainy texture.

## The Seasonings

Classic Southern seasonings include:
- **Smoked paprika** — Adds depth and color
- **Mustard powder** — Brightens the cheese flavor
- **Garlic powder** — Subtle savory note
- **Cayenne** — A hint of heat

Some families add a secret ingredient: a splash of **hot sauce** or **Worcestershire**.

## Why Resting Matters

The 15-20 minute rest isn't optional. The custard continues to set during this time, transforming from jiggly to sliceable. Cut too soon and you'll have a delicious but messy pile.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Using pre-shredded cheese** — Anti-caking agents ruin the texture
2. **Undercooking the pasta** — It needs to be soft for this application
3. **Skipping the eggs** — The custard structure is essential
4. **Not letting it rest** — Patience creates portions
5. **Using only one cheese** — The blend creates complexity

## Make-Ahead Tips

- **Assemble completely** the night before and refrigerate
- **Add 15-20 minutes** to baking time if cold from fridge
- **Splash of milk** when reheating prevents dryness
- **Freezes well** for up to 3 months

## Serving Traditions

Southern mac and cheese is part of the soul food canon, typically served alongside:
- Fried chicken
- Collard greens
- Candied yams
- Cornbread
- Black-eyed peas

It's a required presence at:
- **Thanksgiving dinner** — Non-negotiable
- **Christmas** — Family tradition
- **Church suppers** — Community gathering
- **Juneteenth** — Celebration of freedom
- **Funeral repasts** — Comfort in grief

## From Wings to Pasta

**Buffalo wings** were invented in 1964 at **Anchor Bar, Buffalo, NY** by **Teressa Bellissimo**. The classic sauce is simple: hot sauce and butter. This pasta captures that magic in carb form.

## Buffalo Sauce Formula

Classic ratio: **2 parts hot sauce : 1 part butter**

Frank's RedHot (created 1920) is reportedly the original sauce used.

## Blue Cheese vs. Ranch

- **Traditional Buffalo**: Blue cheese (purists only)
- **Nationwide**: Ranch is acceptable
- **This recipe**: Uses both for maximum flavor

- 120ml ranch dressing

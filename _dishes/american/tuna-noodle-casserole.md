## America's Casserole

First published in 1930 in Sunset Magazine (Pacific Northwest), Tuna Noodle Casserole became a nationwide phenomenon after Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup hit shelves in 1934. By the 1950s, it was the quintessential American casserole.

## The Campbell's Revolution

Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup wasn't just an ingredient—it was a cooking shortcut that defined mid-century American cuisine. It provided a creamy base without making béchamel, democratizing comfort food for busy households.

## Ingredients

### Classic Version
- 350g wide egg noodles
- 2 cans (10.5 oz each) cream of mushroom soup
- 1 cup whole milk
- 2 cans (5 oz each) tuna, drained
- 1 cup frozen peas
- ½ cup shredded cheddar cheese
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Topping
- 2 cups crushed potato chips (classic choice)
- OR 1 cup breadcrumbs mixed with 2 tbsp melted butter

### Optional Add-ins
- Sliced celery
- Diced onion, sautéed
- Sliced mushrooms
- Chopped hard-boiled eggs

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven** to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Cook noodles**: Boil egg noodles until al dente. Drain.

3. **Make sauce**: In a large bowl, whisk soup and milk until smooth.

4. **Combine**: Add drained tuna, peas, half the cheese, and cooked noodles. Season.

5. **Transfer**: Pour into a 9x13 baking dish.

6. **Top**: Sprinkle with remaining cheese and crushed potato chips.

7. **Bake**: 25-30 minutes until bubbling and golden.

## The Potato Chip Topping

Crushed potato chips aren't just nostalgia—they provide:
- Salty crunch contrast
- Golden color
- That unmistakable comfort food appeal

Purists insist on classic ridged chips. Kettle chips work too.

## Homemade Upgrade Version

### From-Scratch Cream Sauce
- 3 tbsp butter
- 8 oz fresh mushrooms, sliced
- 3 tbsp flour
- 2 cups milk
- ½ cup chicken broth
- Salt, pepper, thyme

Sauté mushrooms in butter, add flour, then gradually add milk and broth. Much better than canned.

## History Notes

- **1930**: First published recipe (Sunset Magazine)
- **1934**: Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup introduced
- **1950s**: Peak popularity in American homes
- **Today**: Nostalgic comfort food enjoying revival

## Make-Ahead

- Assemble without topping, refrigerate up to 24 hours
- Add chip topping just before baking
- Freezes well for up to 3 months (without chip topping)

## The K-Food Wave Meets Comfort Food

This isn't traditional Korean cuisine—it's **modern fusion** that emerged in the 2010s-2020s, gaining viral popularity through Korean food creators on TikTok like **Doobydobap**. It represents the global K-food wave meeting America's favorite comfort dish.

## Star Ingredients

- **Gochujang**: Fermented chili paste (sweet, spicy, umami)
- **Well-fermented kimchi**: Older kimchi has the acidity to cut through cheese

## Key Tips

1. **Use well-fermented kimchi**—fresh lacks the acidity to cut richness
2. **Toast gochujang briefly** to mellow raw spice
3. **Finish with butter** for glossy sauce

## Ingredients

### Cheese Sauce
- 450g elbow macaroni
- 60g butter
- 45g flour
- 600ml whole milk
- 200g sharp cheddar, shredded
- 150g mozzarella, shredded
- 2 tablespoons gochujang
- 1 teaspoon garlic, minced
- Salt to taste

### Kimchi
- 200g well-fermented napa cabbage kimchi, chopped
- 2 tablespoons kimchi juice

### Topping
- 100g panko breadcrumbs
- 30g butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes)
- Sliced green onions

## Instructions

### Make the Sauce

1. **Toast gochujang**: In a small pan, cook gochujang 1-2 minutes to mellow. Set aside.

2. **Make roux**: Melt butter in large saucepan. Add garlic, cook 30 seconds. Whisk in flour, cook 2 minutes.

3. **Add milk**: Gradually add milk, whisking until thick.

4. **Add cheese**: Off heat, stir in cheddar and mozzarella until melted.

5. **Add gochujang**: Stir in toasted gochujang.

6. **Add kimchi**: Fold in chopped kimchi and juice.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Cook pasta**: Boil until al dente. Drain.

3. **Combine**: Toss pasta with sauce.

4. **Transfer**: Pour into buttered baking dish.

5. **Make topping**: Mix panko with melted butter and gochugaru.

6. **Top**: Sprinkle panko mixture over pasta.

7. **Bake**: 20-25 minutes until golden and bubbling.

8. **Garnish**: Top with sliced green onions.

## Why Fermented Kimchi?

Fresh kimchi is crunchy and mild. Well-fermented kimchi (at least 2-3 weeks old) has:
- More complex, tangy flavor
- Acidity that cuts through cheese
- Softer texture that integrates better
- Deeper umami

## The Gochujang Secret

Toasting gochujang for a minute before adding it:
- Removes raw fermented taste
- Deepens the flavor
- Mellows the heat slightly
- Makes it more complex

## Serving Suggestions

- Top with a fried egg
- Add crispy bacon or bulgogi
- Serve with pickled radish
- Extra gochugaru for heat lovers

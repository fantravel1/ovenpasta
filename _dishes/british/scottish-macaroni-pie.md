## Scotland's Beloved Pie

In Scotland, mac and cheese doesn't need a plate—it comes in a pie. First recorded in **Dundee and Fife bakeries in the 1920s**, the macaroni pie became an affordable, portable working-class lunch.

## The Greggs Controversy

In 2015, when bakery chain **Greggs** discontinued macaroni pies, over **1,300 petitioners** and even **First Minister Nicola Sturgeon** rallied to **#SaveThePie**. The outcry worked—they're back on menus.

## Hot Water Crust Pastry

The sturdy crust is essential—it must hold its shape for handheld eating. Hot water crust (made with lard and boiling water) creates a rigid shell that doesn't go soggy.

## Ingredients

### Hot Water Crust
- 400g all-purpose flour
- 150g lard
- 150ml water
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 egg beaten with 1 tbsp milk (glaze)

### Mac and Cheese Filling
- 200g elbow macaroni
- 50g butter
- 40g flour
- 400ml whole milk
- 200g mature Scottish cheddar, grated
- 1 teaspoon English mustard
- Salt and white pepper

## Instructions

### Make the Pastry

1. **Heat liquid**: Bring water and lard to a boil.

2. **Add to flour**: Pour into flour and salt. Mix quickly.

3. **Knead briefly**: When cool enough, knead until smooth.

4. **Work quickly**: Pastry must be shaped while warm.

5. **Line molds**: Press ¾ of pastry into individual pie molds (or muffin tin). Reserve rest for lids.

### Make the Filling

1. **Cook macaroni**: Boil until VERY soft (past al dente). Drain.

2. **Make roux**: Melt butter, whisk in flour. Cook 2 minutes.

3. **Add milk**: Gradually add milk, whisking until very thick.

4. **Add cheese**: Stir in cheddar and mustard. Season.

5. **Combine**: Fold in macaroni. The mixture should be very thick.

6. **Cool**: Let filling cool until lukewarm.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (180°C).

2. **Fill pies**: Spoon filling into pastry-lined molds.

3. **Add lids**: Roll remaining pastry, cut circles for tops. Crimp edges.

4. **Vent**: Cut small hole in each lid.

5. **Glaze**: Brush with egg wash.

6. **Bake**: 30-35 minutes until golden.

7. **Cool slightly**: Best eaten warm, not hot.

## Regional Variations

- **Aberdeen**: Haggis layer underneath
- **Glasgow**: Chili flakes or crispy bacon
- **Aberdeenshire**: Macaroni pie inside a morning roll ("carbs on carbs on carbs")

## The Aberdeen Roll

In Aberdeenshire, they put the entire macaroni pie **inside a buttered roll**. This is carb-loading at its most Scottish.

## Best Enjoyed

- Warm from the bakery
- At a football match
- As part of a Scottish lunch (with chips and beans)
- Cut open and drizzled with brown sauce

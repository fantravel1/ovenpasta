## The Pasta That Broke the Internet

In 2019, Finnish food blogger **Jenni Häyrinen** posted a simple recipe called **#uunifetapasta** (oven feta pasta). By February 2021, it had amassed over **600 million TikTok views** and caused feta cheese shortages in grocery stores worldwide.

## Why It Works

The genius is in the simplicity:
- Feta roasts until creamy
- Cherry tomatoes burst and caramelize
- Everything mashes together into a silky sauce
- No cream, no roux, no fuss

## Ingredients

- 400g cherry tomatoes
- 200g block feta cheese
- 4 cloves garlic, smashed
- 75ml extra virgin olive oil
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- Fresh basil leaves
- 350g pasta (penne, rigatoni, or similar)
- Salt and black pepper
- Reserved pasta water

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven** to 400°F (200°C).

2. **Arrange tomatoes**: Place cherry tomatoes in a single layer in a baking dish.

3. **Nestle feta**: Place the block of feta in the center of the tomatoes.

4. **Add garlic**: Scatter smashed garlic around the tomatoes.

5. **Season**: Drizzle everything generously with olive oil. Add red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper.

6. **Roast**: Bake 35-40 minutes until tomatoes burst and feta is golden on edges.

7. **Cook pasta**: While roasting, boil pasta until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta water before draining.

8. **Mash and combine**: Remove from oven. Mash feta and tomatoes together with a fork. Add basil and cooked pasta.

9. **Toss**: Mix everything together, adding pasta water as needed for silky consistency.

10. **Serve**: Immediately, with extra basil and black pepper.

## Tips for Best Results

- **Use good feta**: Greek feta in brine is creamiest
- **Block feta only**: Pre-crumbled won't work the same
- **Don't skip the garlic**: It becomes sweet and mellow when roasted
- **Pasta water is key**: The starch helps bind the sauce

## Variations

### With Protein
Add cooked Italian sausage or grilled chicken.

### Spicier Version
Use more red pepper flakes or add fresh chili.

### With Greens
Fold in fresh spinach or arugula at the end.

### Different Cheese
Try burrata or goat cheese for variation.

## The Global Phenomenon

Grocery stores reported feta shortages in:
- United States
- United Kingdom

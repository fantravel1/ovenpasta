    - "Salt and white pepper"

instructions:
  - section: "Prepare the Eggplant"
    steps:
      - "Slice eggplants into ½-inch rounds. Salt generously and let sit 30 minutes to draw out moisture."
      - "Rinse, pat dry, and brush both sides with olive oil."
      - "Roast at 400°F/200°C for 20-25 minutes until golden and tender. Set aside."
  - section: "Make the Meat Sauce"
    steps:
      - "Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat."
      - "Brown the ground beef, breaking it up, about 8 minutes. Drain excess fat."
      - "Add onion and cook until softened, 5 minutes. Add garlic, cook 1 minute."
      - "Pour in wine and let reduce by half."
      - "Add tomatoes, cinnamon stick, allspice, cloves, salt, and pepper."
      - "Simmer 25-30 minutes until thick. Remove cinnamon stick."
  - section: "Cook the Pasta"
    steps:
      - "Cook pasta in salted water until 2 minutes short of al dente. Drain."
      - "Toss with beaten eggs, grated cheese, and cinnamon while still hot."
  - section: "Make the Béchamel"
    steps:
      - "Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat."
      - "Whisk in flour and cook 2 minutes without browning."
      - "Gradually add warm milk, whisking constantly to prevent lumps."
      - "Cook until thick enough to coat a spoon, about 10 minutes."
      - "Remove from heat. Temper egg yolks with a bit of sauce, then whisk into béchamel."
      - "Stir in cheese, nutmeg, salt, and white pepper."
  - section: "Assemble and Bake"

      - "Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish."
      - "Spread half the pasta in an even layer."
      - "Top with all the meat sauce."
      - "Arrange roasted eggplant slices in a single layer over the meat."
      - "Add remaining pasta."
      - "Pour béchamel over the top, spreading evenly."
      - "Bake at 350°F/180°C for 45 minutes until golden brown and bubbling."
      - "REST 20 MINUTES before cutting—this is essential."

tips:
  - "Salting eggplant removes bitterness and excess moisture for better texture"
  - "The eggplant layer creates a barrier that keeps layers distinct when sliced"
  - "Greek béchamel is richer than French—the eggs are essential"
  - "This dish improves overnight as flavors meld"

history: |
  This fusion dish represents the natural evolution of Greek home cooking, where cooks combine elements
  from their favorite dishes. Both pastitsio and moussaka share the same spice profile (cinnamon,
  allspice, nutmeg) and béchamel topping, making this combination a harmonious marriage.

  In Greek tavernas and home kitchens, this variation emerged as a way to satisfy fans of both dishes
  at once. The eggplant adds the silky richness of moussaka while the pasta provides the satisfying
  heartiness that makes pastitsio a comfort food favorite.

serving_suggestions:
  - "Serve with a crisp Greek salad dressed with olive oil and oregano"
  - "Pair with crusty bread for scooping up any remaining béchamel"
  - "Accompany with a glass of Greek red wine like Xinomavro"

make_ahead: |
  Assemble completely up to 2 days ahead and refrigerate. Add 15-20 minutes to baking time if cold.
  This dish actually improves when made a day ahead—the flavors deepen and the layers set more firmly.
  Freeze unbaked for up to 3 months.

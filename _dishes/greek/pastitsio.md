## Greece's Answer to Lasagna

Pastitsio (παστίτσιο) is the definitive Greek baked pasta, immediately recognizable by its golden, soufflé-like béchamel top and the warm spices—**cinnamon, cloves, and allspice**—that distinguish it from Italian cousins.

While often called "Greek lasagna," pastitsio is its own distinct dish with different structure, spicing, and technique.

## The Defining Characteristics

What makes pastitsio uniquely Greek:

- **Warm spices** — Cinnamon, cloves, and allspice in the meat sauce (non-negotiable)
- **Thick béchamel** — Enriched with eggs and cheese, much thicker than Italian versions
- **Tubular pasta** — Traditionally bucatini or "Pastitsio No. 2" (thick tubes with hollow center)
- **Three distinct layers** — Pasta, meat, pasta, béchamel (not alternating like lasagna)

## Origin & History

The name comes from Italian "pasticcio" (pie), reflecting the cultural exchange across the Mediterranean. But modern Greek pastitsio was standardized by **Nikolaos Tselementes** (1878-1958), a French-trained Greek chef who published influential cookbooks in the early 20th century.

Before Tselementes, Greek pastitsio often included liver and was sometimes wrapped in phyllo dough. He refined it into the dish we know today.

## The Signature Spices

The spice blend is what makes pastitsio taste distinctly Greek:

- **Cinnamon** — The defining Greek flavor, absolutely non-negotiable
- **Allspice** — Key to the "Greekness" of the dish
- **Cloves** — Used whole in the sauce, removed before serving
- **Nutmeg** — Essential in the béchamel

This warm spice profile appears throughout Greek cooking, from moussaka to stifado.

## Greek Béchamel vs. Italian

Greek béchamel is fundamentally different:

| Feature | Greek Béchamel | Italian Béchamel |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Eggs | Yes (yolks added) | No |
| Cheese | Mixed in | Optional topping |
| Consistency | Very thick, soufflé-like | Creamy, pourable |
| Result | Sets firm when baked | Stays creamy |

The eggs create a béchamel that puffs slightly during baking and sets firmly when cooled—essential for the clean slices Greeks expect.

## Pastitsio vs. Moussaka

Both are Greek baked dishes with béchamel, but they're distinct:

| Feature | Pastitsio | Moussaka |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Base | Pasta | Eggplant/potatoes |
| Top layer | Béchamel | Béchamel |
| Spicing | Same warm spices | Same warm spices |
| Popularity | 35% preference | 65% preference |

In Greek polls, moussaka typically wins, but pastitsio has its devoted fans.

## The Pasta Choice

Traditional pastitsio uses **Pastitsio No. 2** pasta—thick tubes with a hollow center, similar to bucatini but slightly wider. The hollow center:

- Traps sauce inside each tube
- Creates lighter texture
- Helps layers hold together

If unavailable, thick bucatini works well. The pasta is mixed with egg whites and cheese before layering, helping it set into a sliceable block.

## Why Resting Matters

**15-20 minutes minimum** after baking. The béchamel continues to set, the layers firm up, and the spices meld. Cut too soon and you'll have a delicious mess.

Many Greek home cooks go further: they insist pastitsio tastes **better the next day** when the flavors have fully developed and the structure is perfectly set.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Skipping the cinnamon** — It's not pastitsio without it
2. **Using thin béchamel** — Greek béchamel must be thick and egg-enriched
3. **Using spaghetti** — Tubular pasta is essential
4. **Cutting too soon** — The rest period is mandatory
5. **Using Italian seasonings** — Oregano yes, but basil and Italian herbs don't belong

## Every Yiayia Has Her Version

While the basic structure remains consistent, Greek grandmothers (yiayias) all have their own touches:

- Some add a layer of feta in the pasta
- Some use lamb instead of beef
- Some add a splash of cream to the meat sauce
- Some top with more cheese for extra crust

The cinnamon, however, is always there. That's what makes it Greek.

## Make-Ahead Tips

Pastitsio is perfect for making ahead:

- **Assemble completely** and refrigerate overnight
- **Add 15 minutes** to baking time if cold
- **Reheats beautifully** — Many say day-two is best
- **Freezes well** for up to 2 months

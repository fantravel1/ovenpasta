## One of Greece's Most Famous Dishes

**Paula Wolfert** called Giouvetsi "one of the most famous of all Greek Island lamb dishes." The name comes from Turkish "güveç"—the earthenware clay pot in which it's traditionally cooked.

## The Critical Tips

1. **Toast the orzo** until golden before adding (prevents gumminess)
2. **3:1 liquid ratio**: 3 cups liquid for every 1 cup orzo
3. **Serve immediately**—orzo keeps absorbing moisture

## Ingredients

### Braised Meat
- 1 kg beef chuck or lamb shoulder, cubed
- 1 large onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 400g crushed tomatoes
- 200ml red wine
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 3 whole cloves
- 3 allspice berries
- 2 bay leaves
- 500ml beef broth
- Olive oil
- Salt and pepper

### Orzo
- 500g orzo (kritharaki)
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 500ml additional broth (warm)
- 100g kefalotýri or Parmesan, grated

## Instructions

### Braise the Meat

1. **Preheat oven** to 325°F (165°C).

2. **Brown meat**: Season beef or lamb. Brown in batches in olive oil in a Dutch oven. Remove.

3. **Cook aromatics**: Add onion, cook until soft. Add garlic.

4. **Add wine**: Pour in wine, scrape up bits, reduce by half.

5. **Add tomatoes and spices**: Stir in tomatoes, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, bay leaves.

6. **Return meat**: Add meat back, pour in broth to almost cover.

7. **Braise**: Cover, bake 1.5-2 hours until meat is tender.

### Add the Orzo

1. **Toast orzo**: Melt butter in a pan, add orzo. Toast, stirring, until golden (5-7 minutes).

2. **Add to meat**: Stir toasted orzo into braising liquid. Add warm broth to ensure enough liquid (3:1 ratio).

3. **Continue baking**: Uncovered, 25-30 minutes until orzo is tender and has absorbed most liquid.

4. **Rest**: Let stand 5 minutes. Remove whole spices.

5. **Serve**: Top with grated cheese.

## Why Toast the Orzo?

Toasting orzo in butter:
- Prevents gummy texture
- Adds nutty flavor
- Helps grains stay distinct
- Traditional technique

## Variations

### Lamb Giouvetsi
Traditional choice. Use lamb shoulder, bone-in for more flavor.

### Chicken Giouvetsi
Faster option. Use bone-in thighs, reduce braising time.

### Shrimp Giouvetsi
Add raw shrimp during last 10 minutes of baking.

## Wine Pairing

- Agiorgitiko
- Naoussa

## Serve Immediately

Giouvetsi waits for no one. The orzo continues absorbing liquid, so serve as soon as it's ready. Leftovers will be drier (still delicious—just add broth when reheating).

## Cyprus's Beloved Baked Pasta

While Greek pastitsio is well-known, Cyprus has its own distinct version that's equally beloved. **Makaronia tou Fournou** ("macaroni from the oven") features the island's signature ingredients: halloumi cheese and dried mint.

## Key Differences from Greek Pastitsio

| Feature | Greek Pastitsio | Cypriot Makaronia |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Meat** | Beef | Pork |
| **Cheese** | Kefalotyri/Parmesan | Halloumi/Anari |
| **Herb** | Parsley | Dried Mint |
| **Spices** | Cinnamon, allspice | Cinnamon |

## Ingredients

### Meat Sauce
- 500g ground pork
- 1 large onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 400g crushed tomatoes
- 150ml red wine
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 2 teaspoons dried mint
- Salt and pepper
- Olive oil

### Béchamel
- 1 liter milk
- 75g butter
- 75g flour
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 100g halloumi, grated
- Nutmeg, salt, white pepper

### Assembly
- 500g penne or tubular pasta
- 150g halloumi, grated
- 50g anari (Cypriot ricotta) or regular ricotta
- Dried mint for sprinkling

## Instructions

### Make the Meat Sauce

1. **Brown pork**: Heat oil, cook pork until browned. Add onion and garlic.

2. **Add liquids**: Pour in wine, let reduce. Add tomatoes, cinnamon stick, and mint.

3. **Simmer**: Cook 25-30 minutes until thick. Remove cinnamon stick. Season.

### Make the Béchamel

1. **Make roux**: Melt butter, whisk in flour, cook 2 minutes.

2. **Add milk**: Gradually add warm milk, whisking constantly until thick.

3. **Temper eggs**: Add a little hot sauce to beaten eggs, then pour eggs into sauce.

4. **Add cheese**: Stir in grated halloumi. Season with nutmeg, salt, pepper.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (180°C).

2. **Cook pasta**: Boil until al dente. Drain.

3. **Layer**: Mix pasta with meat sauce and half the halloumi. Transfer to baking dish.

4. **Top**: Pour béchamel over pasta. Sprinkle with remaining halloumi and dried mint.

5. **Bake**: 40-45 minutes until golden.

6. **Rest**: 15-20 minutes before cutting.

## The Halloumi Difference

Halloumi—the squeaky Cypriot cheese—doesn't melt like other cheeses. Instead, it softens and adds a distinctive texture and salty flavor throughout the dish.

## Dried Mint: The Cypriot Signature

Where Greek cooking might use fresh parsley, Cypriot cuisine loves dried mint. Its intensity and slightly dusty, sweet quality is unmistakable.

## Yoshoku: Japan's Western Cuisine

**Yoshoku** (洋食) refers to Western dishes adapted to Japanese tastes during the Meiji era (1868-1912). Macaroni Gratin is a beloved example—children's comfort food with strong nostalgia for many Japanese adults.

## Key Distinction

This is **NOT mac and cheese**:
- Uses **béchamel sauce** (not cheese sauce)
- Cheese is **ONLY a topping**, not mixed throughout
- Features proteins (chicken, shrimp)
- Topped with **panko** for signature char

## Ingredients

### Proteins
- 200g chicken breast, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 200g shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 tablespoon sake (for marinating shrimp)

### Vegetables
- 200g mushrooms (shimeji, button, or mixed), sliced
- 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons butter

### Béchamel Sauce
- 60g butter
- 60g flour
- 700ml whole milk
- 100ml heavy cream
- Salt, white pepper, nutmeg

### Assembly
- 250g elbow macaroni
- 100g mozzarella or Gruyère, shredded
- 50g panko breadcrumbs
- Fresh parsley

## Instructions

### Prepare Proteins

1. **Marinate shrimp**: Toss with sake to remove fishy odor.

2. **Slice chicken**: Use **sogigiri** (diagonal slicing) for even cooking.

3. **Sauté**: Cook chicken and shrimp in butter until just done. Remove.

### Prepare Vegetables

1. **Cook onion**: Sauté in butter until translucent.

2. **Add mushrooms**: Cook until golden. Set aside with proteins.

### Make Béchamel

1. **Make roux**: Melt butter, whisk in flour. Cook 2 minutes.

2. **Add dairy**: Gradually add milk and cream, whisking constantly.

3. **Cook**: Stir until thick and smooth. Season.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 450°F (230°C) or turn on broiler.

2. **Cook macaroni**: Boil until al dente. Drain.

3. **Combine**: Mix pasta, proteins, vegetables, and béchamel.

4. **Transfer**: Divide among individual gratin dishes or one large dish.

5. **Top**: Sprinkle with cheese, then panko.

6. **Broil/Bake**: 10-15 minutes until panko is golden and charred in spots.

## The Panko Secret

Panko creates the signature **kogashi** (charred bits) that are essential to Japanese gratin. The irregular crumbs crisp better than regular breadcrumbs.

## Individual vs. Family Style

In Japan, gratin is often served in individual **gratin dishes**—small, oval ceramic dishes that go directly from oven to table.

## Yoshoku Restaurant Standards

At Japanese family restaurants (famires), gratin arrives:
- Bubbling hot
- With charred panko edges
- On a metal platter with wooden base
- Often with rice or bread on the side

## Variations

### Seafood Gratin
Replace chicken with scallops or crab.

### Doria
Similar dish but with **rice** instead of pasta—another Yoshoku classic.

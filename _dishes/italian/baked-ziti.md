## The Wedding Dish

"Ziti" derives from "zita" meaning bride—this dish was traditionally served at Italian weddings as "maccheroni della zita." Today it's the quintessential Italian-American comfort food, equally at home at celebrations and weeknight dinners.

## Italian vs. Italian-American

| Feature | Italian (Neapolitan) | Italian-American |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| Binder | Béchamel | Ricotta |
| Mozzarella | Fresh | Low-moisture |
| Meat | Meatballs in sauce | Ground meat mixed in |
| Complexity | More refined | Heartier, cheesier |

## The Ricotta Cream Trick

Mix your ricotta with an egg before layering:
- Creates better structure
- Prevents grainy texture
- Easier to spread evenly

## Why Undercook the Pasta

Cook pasta **2 minutes less** than package directions. It will:
- Finish cooking in the oven
- Absorb sauce flavors
- Maintain good texture

## Fresh Mozzarella Warning

Use **low-moisture mozzarella** (not fresh). Fresh mozzarella:
- Releases water during baking
- Makes dish soggy
- Doesn't melt as evenly

Pre-shredded works but fresh-shredded (without anti-caking agents) is better.

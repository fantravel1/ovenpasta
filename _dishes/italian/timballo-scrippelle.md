## Abruzzo's Hidden Treasure

From the Teramo province of Abruzzo comes one of Italy's most fascinating baked pastas—layers of delicate water-based crepes (scrippelle) alternating with impossibly tiny meatballs (pallottine), all bound by egg wash (bagnata) and baked until the layers merge into something magical.

This dish gained international recognition on **CNN's "Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy"**, where the actor marveled at the intricate construction and deep flavors.

## The Three Defining Elements

1. **Scrippelle**: Water-based crepes (NOT French-style milk crepes)
2. **Pallottine**: Meatballs that MUST be corn-kernel sized (1cm)
3. **Bagnata**: Egg wash brushed between every layer

## Traditional Formula for Scrippelle

*"1 egg, 1 heaping tablespoon flour, 1 eggshell of water per person"*

This traditional Abruzzese formula scales perfectly for any gathering.

## Ingredients

### Scrippelle (Water-Based Crepes)
- 6 large eggs
- 6 heaping tablespoons flour
- 6 eggshells of water (about 1 cup)
- Pinch of salt
- Freshly grated Pecorino for sprinkling
- Fresh parsley, minced

### Pallottine (Tiny Meatballs)
- 400g mixed ground beef and pork
- 50g breadcrumbs
- 50g Pecorino Romano, grated
- 1 egg
- Fresh parsley, minced
- Salt and pepper
- Olive oil for frying

### Simple Tomato Sauce
- 500g tomato passata
- 2 cloves garlic
- Fresh basil
- Olive oil
- Salt

### Bagnata (Egg Wash)
- 4 eggs, beaten with 2 tbsp milk
- 50g Pecorino Romano, grated

### For Assembly
- 200g fresh mozzarella, shredded
- 100g Pecorino Romano, grated
- Butter for the pan

## Instructions

### Make the Scrippelle

1. **Mix batter**: Whisk eggs, flour, water, and salt until smooth.

2. **Rest**: Let batter rest 15 minutes.

3. **Cook crepes**: Heat a small non-stick pan, lightly oil. Pour thin layer of batter, swirl to coat. Cook until edges lift, flip briefly. They should be very thin and lacy.

4. **Add toppings**: While still warm, sprinkle each scrippelle with Pecorino and parsley. Stack as you go.

### Make the Pallottine

1. **Combine**: Mix beef, pork, breadcrumbs, Pecorino, egg, and parsley. Season.

2. **Form TINY balls**: Roll into corn-kernel sized balls—about 1cm diameter. This is non-negotiable; larger meatballs don't distribute properly.

3. **Fry**: Cook in batches in olive oil until golden all over. Drain.

### Make the Sauce

1. **Simple preparation**: Sauté garlic in oil, add passata and basil, simmer 20 minutes. Season.

### Make the Bagnata

1. **Whisk**: Beat eggs with milk and Pecorino until combined.

### Assemble the Timballo

1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (180°C).

2. **Prepare mold**: Butter a deep round baking dish or springform pan.

3. **First layer**: Place scrippelle on bottom, slightly overlapping.

4. **Build layers**:
   - Brush with bagnata
   - Add scrippelle
   - Scatter pallottine
   - Drizzle tomato sauce
   - Sprinkle mozzarella and Pecorino
   - Brush bagnata

5. **Repeat**: Continue layering until all ingredients are used (aim for 8-10 layers).

6. **Final top**: End with scrippelle, bagnata, and cheese.

7. **Bake**: 45-60 minutes until golden and set.

8. **Rest**: Let stand 15 minutes before slicing.

## The Layering Philosophy

The layers of a Timballo di Scrippelle are said to mirror the geological strata of the nearby Gran Sasso mountains—Abruzzo's culinary ode to its landscape.

## Why Water-Based Crepes?

Unlike French crêpes made with milk, scrippelle are made with water. This creates:
- Lighter, lacier texture
- Better absorption of the bagnata
- Distinct flavor that melds with the fillings

## Wine Pairing

- **Montepulciano d'Abruzzo** (the obvious local choice)
- **Cerasuolo d'Abruzzo** (rosé version)
- **Trebbiano d'Abruzzo** (for white wine lovers)

## Make-Ahead

- **Scrippelle**: Make day ahead, refrigerate stacked
- **Pallottine**: Fry 2 days ahead, refrigerate
- **Sauce**: Make 3 days ahead
- **Assembled**: Can be assembled and refrigerated overnight; add 15 minutes to baking time

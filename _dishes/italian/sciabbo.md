## Sicily's Secret Christmas Dish

In the Province of Enna, in central Sicily, Christmas dinner features something that surprises most first-time tasters: pasta with chocolate. **Sciabbò** combines slow-braised pork with unsweetened cocoa powder and cinnamon—a combination that sounds unlikely but tastes magnificent.

Savory dishes with chocolate have been documented in Italy since 1680, but Sciabbò reflects Sicily's unique position at the crossroads of Arab and Spanish culinary traditions.

## Why Chocolate Works in Savory Dishes

The cocoa doesn't make this dish sweet. Instead, it:
- **Adds umami depth** and richness
- **Smooths the acidity** of tomatoes
- **Creates a velvety mouthfeel**
- **Enhances meaty flavors** without sweetness
- **Adds complexity** impossible to achieve otherwise

The cinnamon is the partner that makes it work—together they create something that tastes neither sweet nor strange, just deeply satisfying.

## Non-Negotiables

- **Dark chocolate or unsweetened cocoa** (NEVER milk chocolate)
- **Cinnamon always accompanies chocolate**
- **Slow-braised pork** (not ground meat)
- **Wide pasta** like pappardelle or tagliatelle

## Ingredients

### Braised Pork
- 900g (2 lbs) pork shoulder, cut into large chunks
- 400g crushed tomatoes (San Marzano preferred)
- 200ml red wine (Nero d'Avola ideal)
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 bay leaves
- Fresh thyme
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper

### To Serve
- 500g pappardelle or tagliatelle
- Fresh parsley
- Pecorino Romano, grated

## Instructions

### Braise the Pork

1. **Brown the meat**: Pat pork dry, season generously. Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown pork on all sides in batches. Remove and set aside.

2. **Build aromatics**: Reduce heat, add onion to the pot. Cook until softened, about 8 minutes. Add garlic, cook 1 minute.

3. **Add wine**: Pour in red wine, scraping up all the browned bits. Let reduce by half.

4. **Add tomatoes**: Stir in crushed tomatoes, bay leaves, and thyme.

5. **Return pork**: Nestle the browned pork into the sauce.

6. **Braise low and slow**: Cover and cook at 300°F (150°C) for 3-3.5 hours until pork is fall-apart tender.

### Finish the Sauce

1. **Shred the pork**: Remove meat, shred with two forks.

2. **Add chocolate and cinnamon**: Stir cocoa powder and cinnamon into the braising liquid. Mix until completely incorporated.

3. **Combine**: Return shredded pork to sauce. Taste and adjust seasoning.

4. **Rest**: Let sauce rest while you cook pasta (flavors continue melding).

### Serve

1. **Cook pasta**: Boil pappardelle until al dente.

2. **Toss**: Drain pasta (reserve some water), toss with sauce. Add pasta water if needed for consistency.

3. **Serve**: Portion into warm bowls, sprinkle with parsley and Pecorino.

## Historical Context

Sicily's unique cuisine reflects centuries of conquest and cultural exchange:
- **Arab rule (827-1091 CE)**: Introduced spices, including cinnamon
- **Spanish rule (1516-1713)**: Brought chocolate from the New World
- **Italian traditions**: Provided the pasta foundation

Sciabbò is living history on a plate—a dish that could only exist in Sicily.

## The Science Behind It

Cocoa contains over 300 volatile compounds that interact with the Maillard reaction products from browning meat. The result is enhanced perception of savory, meaty flavors without any chocolate taste.

The key is using UNSWEETENED cocoa—sugar would throw off the entire balance.

## Tips for Success

1. **Toast the cocoa briefly**: Stirring it into warm sauce helps bloom the flavors
2. **Don't skimp on braising time**: The pork needs to be falling apart
3. **Let the sauce rest**: The chocolate flavor mellows and integrates
4. **Use good cocoa**: Dutch-process cocoa gives a smoother flavor

## Wine Pairing

- **Nero d'Avola** (the wine of choice in Enna)
- **Cerasuolo di Vittoria**
- **Etna Rosso**

## Make-Ahead

This dish is **better the next day**. The flavors meld and the chocolate integration becomes seamless.

- **Braise ahead**: Make 2-3 days before, refrigerate
- **Reheat gently**: Add splash of water if needed
- **Fresh pasta**: Cook just before serving

## Sunday Lunch in Sicily

While Timballo di Anelletti is Palermo's show-stopping drum-shaped creation, **Pasta al Forno Siciliana** is the everyday baked pasta found across the island. It shares many ingredients but is simpler to prepare—a straightforward casserole rather than an unmolded spectacle.

This is the pasta of Sunday lunches, beach picnics, and Ferragosto (August 15th) celebrations.

## Authentic Markers

- **Anelletti pasta** (ring-shaped, exclusive to Sicily)
- **Caciocavallo cheese** (aged, stretched-curd cheese)
- **Breadcrumb crust** on BOTH bottom and top
- **Hard-boiled eggs** layered within
- **Peas in the ragù**
- **Served at room temperature** for beach picnics

## Ingredients

### Ragù
- 500g mixed ground beef and pork
- 400g tomato passata
- 150g frozen peas
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 150ml red wine
- Fresh basil
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper

### Eggplant
- 2 large eggplants
- Vegetable oil for frying
- Salt

### Tiny Meatballs (Optional)
- 200g ground beef
- 30g breadcrumbs
- 1 egg
- Fresh parsley
- Salt

### Assembly
- 500g anelletti pasta
- 150g caciocavallo, grated
- 100g mozzarella, cubed
- 4 hard-boiled eggs, sliced
- 100g fine breadcrumbs
- Olive oil for the pan

## Instructions

### Make the Ragù

1. **Sauté aromatics**: Heat olive oil, cook onion until soft. Add garlic.

2. **Brown meat**: Add ground meat, break up, cook until browned.

3. **Add wine**: Pour in wine, let reduce by half.

4. **Add tomatoes**: Stir in passata, season, add basil.

5. **Simmer**: Cook 45 minutes to 1 hour. Add peas in last 15 minutes.

### Prepare Eggplant

1. **Slice**: Cut eggplants into ½-inch rounds or cubes.

2. **Salt**: Layer in colander, salt generously. Let drain 30 minutes.

3. **Dry and fry**: Pat dry, fry in batches until golden. Drain on paper towels.

### Make Meatballs (If Using)

1. **Mix**: Combine beef, breadcrumbs, egg, and parsley.

2. **Form**: Roll into marble-sized balls.

3. **Fry**: Cook until golden all over. Set aside.

### Cook Pasta

1. **Boil**: Cook anelletti until 2 minutes shy of al dente.

2. **Drain**: Reserve some pasta water.

3. **Toss**: Mix pasta with about half the ragù.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (180°C).

2. **Prepare pan**: Oil a deep 9x13 baking dish. Coat bottom and sides with breadcrumbs.

3. **First layer**: Add half the dressed pasta.

4. **Add fillings**: Layer half the eggplant, mozzarella cubes, caciocavallo, egg slices, and meatballs (if using).

5. **Second layer**: Add remaining pasta, then remaining fillings.

6. **Top**: Spoon remaining ragù over everything. Sprinkle generously with breadcrumbs and drizzle with olive oil.

7. **Bake**: 35-45 minutes until golden and crusty on top.

8. **Rest**: Let stand 15 minutes before cutting.

## The Double Breadcrumb Technique

The breadcrumbs on the bottom create a crispy base that prevents sticking and adds texture. The top layer becomes golden and crunchy. This is characteristic of Sicilian baked pastas.

## Serving Temperatures

- **Hot**: Fresh from the oven for Sunday lunch
- **Room temperature**: Traditional for beach picnics—it travels well and the flavors actually improve
- **Never cold from refrigerator**: Always let it warm up

## Substitutions

If you can't find anelletti:
- **Ditalini**: Closest substitute
- **Small shells**: Work in a pinch
- **Tubetti**: Another option

Note: True Sicilians would insist on the real thing—anelletti are sometimes available online.

## Wine Pairing

- Nero d'Avola
- Frappato
- Cerasuolo di Vittoria

## Make-Ahead

- **Ragù**: Make 2-3 days ahead
- **Fry eggplant**: Day before
- **Boil eggs**: Day before
- **Assembled**: Refrigerate unbaked overnight, add baking time

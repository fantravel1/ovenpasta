## The Carnival Lasagna of Naples

Lasagna Napoletana is the magnificent Southern Italian answer to Bolognese lasagna—and they couldn't be more different. Where Bologna uses béchamel, Naples uses ricotta. Where the North favors fresh egg pasta, the South uses dry durum wheat sheets. And where Bolognese is restrained elegance, Napoletana is baroque abundance.

This is the lasagna that earned King Ferdinand II of Bourbon the nickname **"Re Lasagna"** (King Lasagna) for his passionate devotion to the dish. It remains mandatory for **Martedì Grasso** (Fat Tuesday)—the feast before Lenten fasting begins.

## Ingredients

### Ragù Napoletano
- 300g pork ribs
- 200g Italian sausage
- 1 kg San Marzano tomatoes, crushed
- 60g each: onion, carrot, celery (soffritto)
- 200ml extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tbsp lard
- 200ml red wine
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Tiny Meatballs (Polpettine)
- 200g ground veal
- 300g ground pork
- 50g Pecorino Romano, grated
- 100g bread, soaked in milk and squeezed
- 4 eggs (2 for meatballs, 2 beaten for binding)
- Fresh parsley, minced
- Salt and pepper

### Assembly
- 1 kg dry durum wheat lasagna sheets
- 500g fresh ricotta
- 250g caciocavallo or provolone, sliced
- 200g salami (Napoli or Genoa), diced
- 5 hard-boiled eggs, sliced
- 100g Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated

## Instructions

### Make the Ragù (Day Before Recommended)

1. **Brown the meats**: Heat olive oil and lard in a large Dutch oven. Brown pork ribs and sausages on all sides. Remove and set aside.

2. **Build the base**: Add soffritto to the pot and cook until softened, about 10 minutes.

3. **Add wine**: Pour in red wine and scrape up browned bits. Let it reduce by half.

4. **Add tomatoes**: Pour in crushed San Marzano tomatoes. Return meats to pot.

5. **Simmer low and slow**: Cover and cook at the barest simmer ("pippiare" in Neapolitan—just barely bubbling) for 3-4 hours. The meat should be falling off the bone.

6. **Separate**: Remove meats (serve as second course). Keep tomato sauce for lasagna.

### Make the Meatballs

1. Combine veal, pork, soaked bread, Pecorino, parsley, and 2 eggs.

2. Form into **grape-sized balls** (about 1.5cm)—this size ensures even cooking.

3. Fry in batches in olive oil until golden. Drain on paper towels.

### Assemble the Lasagna

1. **Preheat oven** to 400°F (200°C).

2. **Cook pasta**: Boil lasagna sheets in salted water until just pliable (they'll finish in oven). Lay flat on clean towels.

3. **Spread base**: Ladle ragù on bottom of a deep 9x13 inch baking dish.

4. **First layer**: Lay pasta sheets, spread ricotta, scatter meatballs, add egg slices, salami, and caciocavallo. Ladle more ragù.

5. **Repeat**: Continue layering (aim for 5-6 layers), ending with ragù and generous Parmigiano.

6. **Bake**: Cover with foil, bake 30 minutes. Remove foil, bake 15-20 minutes more until bubbling and golden.

7. **Rest**: Let stand 30 minutes before cutting—*"S'add a ripusà"* (it must rest) as Neapolitans say.

## The Key Differences from Bolognese

| Feature | Bolognese | Napoletana |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Binder** | Béchamel | Ricotta |
| **Pasta** | Fresh egg pasta | Dry durum wheat |
| **Additions** | None | Meatballs, eggs, salami |
| **Meat** | Ground, in sauce | Whole cuts, served separately |
| **Region** | Emilia-Romagna | Campania |

## History & Origin

Born during the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, this lasagna represents Neapolitan culinary philosophy: abundance, celebration, and no restraint. The dish is inseparable from Carnival celebrations—the period of feasting before the 40 days of Lenten fasting.

Ferdinand II of Bourbon (1810-1859) loved this dish so much that "Re Lasagna" became his popular nickname. His devotion helped cement the dish's status as the ultimate Neapolitan celebration food.

## Chef's Notes

- **The meatballs must be tiny**—grape-sized ensures they cook evenly and distribute throughout the layers
- **Use dry pasta, not fresh**—this is a Southern tradition, and dry durum wheat pasta has the structure to hold up to the rich, wet filling
- **Rest is mandatory**—30 minutes minimum allows the layers to set for clean slices
- **Make ragù the day before**—it only improves overnight

## Wine Pairing

- Aglianico del Taburno
- Taurasi
- Lacryma Christi del Vesuvio Rosso

- **Meatballs**: Fry 2 days ahead; refrigerate

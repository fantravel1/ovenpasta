## Catherine de' Medici's Legacy

Legend connects Crespelle alla Fiorentina to **Catherine de' Medici**, who allegedly brought these spinach-filled crepes (and her Florentine chefs) to France when she married King Henry II in 1533.

Whether or not the story is true, this is why dishes called "alla fiorentina" worldwide typically contain spinach—attributed to Catherine's love of the vegetable.

## Also Known As...

**"Pezzole della nonna"** (grandma's handkerchiefs)—a name that perfectly describes their triangular folded shape, reminiscent of the handkerchiefs grandmothers tucked into their sleeves.

## The Dual-Sauce Tradition

Traditional Crespelle alla Fiorentina feature BOTH:
- **Béchamel sauce** (white, creamy)
- **Tomato purée** (red, tangy)

This combination creates the classic red-and-white presentation and balances richness with brightness.

## Ingredients

### Crespelle (Italian Crepes)
- 3 large eggs
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 300ml whole milk
- Pinch of salt
- Butter for cooking

### Spinach-Ricotta Filling
- 500g fresh spinach (or 300g frozen, thawed)
- 400g fresh ricotta
- 100g Pecorino Toscano or Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated
- 2 egg yolks
- Freshly grated nutmeg (generous)
- Salt and pepper

### Béchamel Sauce
- 500ml whole milk
- 40g butter
- 40g flour
- Nutmeg, salt

### Tomato Element
- 200ml tomato purée or passata
- Fresh basil

### For Topping
- 50g Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated
- Butter

## Instructions

### Make the Crespelle

1. **Blend batter**: Whisk eggs, flour, milk, and salt until smooth.

2. **Rest**: Let batter rest 15 minutes.

3. **Cook**: Heat butter in a small pan over medium heat. Pour thin layer of batter, swirl, cook until edges lift. Flip briefly. These should be thin and delicate.

4. **Stack**: Layer finished crespelle between parchment or stack directly.

### Make the Filling

1. **Cook spinach**: Wilt fresh spinach in a dry pan, or squeeze thawed frozen spinach very dry.

2. **Chop finely**: Mince the spinach.

3. **Combine**: Mix spinach with ricotta, Pecorino, egg yolks, and nutmeg. Season well.

### Make the Béchamel

1. **Melt butter**: In a saucepan over medium heat.

2. **Add flour**: Whisk in flour, cook 2 minutes.

3. **Add milk**: Gradually pour in warm milk, whisking constantly.

4. **Cook**: Stir until thick, about 10 minutes. Season with nutmeg and salt.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (180°C).

2. **Fill crespelle**: Place about 2 tablespoons filling on each crespelle.

3. **Fold**: Fold in half, then in half again to form triangles (like folding a handkerchief).

4. **Arrange**: Place folded crespelle in a buttered baking dish, slightly overlapping.

5. **Sauce**: Drizzle béchamel over the crespelle, then dollop tomato purée in artistic patterns.

6. **Top**: Sprinkle with Parmigiano and dot with butter.

7. **Bake**: 20-25 minutes until golden and bubbling.

8. **Serve**: Garnish with fresh basil.

## The Triangular Fold

The classic "handkerchief" fold:
1. Spread filling across one half
2. Fold crespelle in half (semicircle)
3. Fold again into a triangle

This creates neat, stackable portions and ensures filling in every bite.

## Variations

### With Prosciutto
Add thin slices of prosciutto to the filling for a non-vegetarian version.

### All-White Version
Skip the tomato, use only béchamel, add sage-infused brown butter drizzle.

### Gratinéed Style
Top with extra cheese and broil until golden and bubbly.

## Wine Pairing

- **Chianti Classico**
- **Vernaccia di San Gimignano** (white)
- **Rosso di Montalcino**

## Make-Ahead

- **Crespelle**: Make 2 days ahead, refrigerate between parchment
- **Filling**: Make day ahead, refrigerate
- **Béchamel**: Make day ahead, press plastic directly on surface
- **Assembled**: Refrigerate unbaked up to 24 hours

## A Note on "Florentine"

Whenever you see "alla fiorentina" on a menu anywhere in the world—from Eggs Florentine to sole Florentine—expect spinach. Whether Catherine de' Medici truly deserves credit or not, Florence and spinach are forever linked in culinary imagination.

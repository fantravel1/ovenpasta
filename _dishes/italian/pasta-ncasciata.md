## The Detective's Favorite Dish

Pasta 'Ncasciata achieved international fame through Andrea Camilleri's beloved **Inspector Montalbano** novels. In "The Terracotta Dog," Camilleri writes: *"In the oven sat, as on a throne, a casserole with four huge servings of pasta 'ncasciata, a dish worthy of Olympus."*

This is the dish that Montalbano's housekeeper Adelina prepares to reward him for a case well solved. And after making it yourself, you'll understand the detective's devotion.

## How It Differs from Timballo

| Feature | Pasta 'Ncasciata | Timballo di Anelletti |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Construction** | Single layer, casserole | Drum-shaped, unmolded |
| **Pasta** | Tortiglioni or rigatoni | Anelletti (rings) |
| **Origin** | Messina | Palermo |
| **Presentation** | Served from dish | Unmolded dramatically |

## Ingredients

### Meat Sauce
- 500g ground beef
- 400g tomato passata
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 150ml red wine
- Fresh basil
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper

### Assembly
- 500g tortiglioni or rigatoni
- 2 large eggplants, sliced and fried
- 200g caciocavallo or provolone, sliced
- 150g salami (preferably Sicilian), cubed
- 4 hard-boiled eggs, sliced
- 100g breadcrumbs
- 100g Pecorino Romano, grated
- Extra virgin olive oil

## Instructions

### Prepare Components

1. **Fry eggplant**: Slice eggplants about 1cm thick. Salt, drain 30 minutes, pat dry. Fry until golden. Drain on paper towels.

2. **Make meat sauce**: Sauté onion and garlic in olive oil. Add ground beef, brown well. Add wine, reduce. Add passata, basil, season. Simmer 30-40 minutes.

3. **Hard-boil eggs**: Cook eggs, cool, peel, and slice.

4. **Cook pasta**: Boil tortiglioni until 2 minutes shy of al dente. Drain, reserving some pasta water.

5. **Toss pasta**: Mix pasta with about two-thirds of the meat sauce.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Prepare dish**: Oil a large baking dish (9x13 inch). Coat bottom with breadcrumbs.

3. **Build layers**:
   - Half the dressed pasta
   - Half the fried eggplant
   - Half the salami
   - Half the egg slices
   - Half the caciocavallo
   - Remaining pasta
   - Remaining eggplant, salami, eggs, caciocavallo

4. **Top**: Drizzle with remaining sauce, sprinkle with Pecorino and breadcrumbs, drizzle with olive oil.

5. **Bake**: 30-40 minutes until golden and bubbling.

6. **Rest**: Let stand 10 minutes before serving.

## The Camilleri Connection

Andrea Camilleri (1925-2019) created Inspector Salvo Montalbano in 1994, and food—particularly Sicilian food—became central to the character's identity. Pasta 'Ncasciata appears throughout the series as the ultimate comfort food, prepared by his devoted housekeeper Adelina.

The novels (and their Italian TV adaptations) sparked culinary tourism to Sicily, with fans seeking out the dishes that fuel the detective's investigations.

## Authentic Tips

- **Messina style**: Unlike the Palermo timballo, this is a straightforward casserole—no unmolding required
- **The salami matters**: Use good Sicilian salami or sopressata
- **Caciocavallo is key**: This stretched-curd cheese (literally "cheese on horseback") is quintessentially Southern Italian
- **Don't skip the hard-boiled eggs**: They're traditional and add richness

## Wine Pairing

- Nero d'Avola
- Cerasuolo di Vittoria
- Etna Rosso

## Make-Ahead

- All components can be prepared a day ahead
- Assemble the morning of, refrigerate, add 15 minutes to baking time
- Leftovers reheat beautifully (Montalbano would approve)

## A Dish Worthy of Olympus

As Camilleri wrote, this is food fit for the gods. It's hearty, layered, and satisfying in a way that only Sicilian cooking achieves. No wonder a fictional detective—and countless real readers—have fallen in love with it.

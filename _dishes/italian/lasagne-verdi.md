## The Official Recipe

On May 28, 2003, the **Accademia Italiana della Cucina** officially registered the recipe for Lasagne Verdi alla Bolognese. This isn't just tradition—it's cultural heritage with an official stamp.

The "verdi" (green) comes from spinach incorporated directly into the pasta dough, creating beautiful emerald sheets that are as delicate as they are flavorful.

## What Makes It Authentic

- **Fresh spinach egg pasta** (NOT regular sheets dyed green)
- **Ragù Bolognese** (slow-cooked, milk-enriched)
- **Béchamel sauce** (NOT ricotta)
- **Parmigiano-Reggiano ONLY** (absolutely NO mozzarella)
- **5-7 thin, delicate layers**
- **NO GARLIC** in traditional Bolognese ragù
- **NO HERBS** (basil, oregano are excluded)

## Ingredients

### Spinach Pasta (Sfoglia Verde)
- 340g 00 flour
- 4 large eggs
- 160g fresh spinach (cooked weight)
- Pinch of salt

### Ragù Bolognese
- 400g coarsely ground beef (preferably chuck)
- 150g fresh pancetta, finely diced
- 60g onion, finely diced
- 60g carrot, finely diced
- 60g celery, finely diced
- ½ cup dry red wine
- 200g tomato passata
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- ½ cup whole milk
- Beef or veal broth as needed
- Salt and pepper

### Béchamel
- 1 liter whole milk
- 100g butter
- 100g flour
- Freshly grated nutmeg
- Salt

### Assembly
- 100g Parmigiano-Reggiano, freshly grated
- Butter for the dish

## Instructions

### Make the Spinach Pasta

1. **Cook spinach**: Blanch fresh spinach until wilted. Drain and squeeze COMPLETELY DRY—this is critical or your pasta will be gummy.

2. **Purée**: Process spinach until very smooth.

3. **Make dough**: Mound flour on work surface, make well. Add eggs, spinach purée, and salt.

4. **Knead**: Work dough until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.

5. **Rest**: Wrap in plastic, rest 30 minutes.

6. **Roll thin**: Using pasta machine, roll to thinnest setting. You should almost be able to see through it.

7. **Cut**: Cut into sheets that fit your baking dish.

### Make the Ragù (Minimum 2 Hours)

1. **Render pancetta**: Cook diced pancetta in a heavy pot until fat renders.

2. **Add soffritto**: Add onion, carrot, celery. Cook gently until softened (10-15 minutes).

3. **Brown meat**: Add ground beef, breaking it up. Cook until no longer pink.

4. **Add wine**: Pour in red wine, let it evaporate completely.

5. **Add tomatoes**: Stir in passata and tomato paste.

6. **Simmer long**: Add just enough broth to cover. Simmer VERY gently for 2+ hours (4 hours is ideal), adding broth as needed.

7. **Add milk**: In the last 30 minutes, stir in milk. This is the Bolognese secret.

8. **Season**: Salt and pepper to taste. The ragù should be thick and rich.

### Make the Béchamel

1. **Melt butter** in a saucepan over medium heat.

2. **Add flour**: Whisk in flour, cook 2 minutes without browning.

3. **Add milk gradually**: Pour in warm milk in a steady stream, whisking constantly.

4. **Cook until thick**: Stir until sauce coats the back of a spoon (10-12 minutes).

5. **Season**: Add nutmeg and salt.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Par-boil pasta**: Cook pasta sheets briefly (30 seconds), shock in ice water, lay on clean towels.

3. **Butter the dish**: Generously butter a deep 9x13 inch baking dish.

4. **Start layering**: Begin with a thin layer of ragù.

5. **Build layers**: Pasta, thin spread of ragù, thin drizzle of béchamel, light dusting of Parmigiano. Repeat 5-7 times.

6. **Top layer**: End with béchamel and generous Parmigiano.

7. **Bake**: 30-35 minutes until golden and bubbling.

8. **Rest**: Let stand 15-20 minutes before cutting.

## The Layering Secret

Each component layer should be THIN. The magic of lasagne verdi is in the delicate balance, not in thick, heavy layers. Traditional Bolognese lasagne might have 7 or more paper-thin pasta layers.

## Critical Technique Notes

- **Spinach must be BONE DRY**: Any moisture makes gummy pasta
- **Roll pasta very thin**: Should almost see through it
- **Ragù needs time**: 2 hours minimum, 4 hours ideal
- **Thin layers**: Light application of each component
- **Rest before cutting**: 15-20 minutes minimum

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Adding mozzarella (NEVER—this is not Southern Italian lasagna)
- Using pre-shredded Parmesan (always freshly grate)
- Adding garlic to the ragù (not traditional)
- Adding herbs like basil or oregano (not traditional)
- Making layers too thick
- Skipping the resting time

## Wine Pairing

- **Lambrusco di Sorbara** (traditional, sparkling red)
- **Sangiovese di Romagna**
- **Barbera d'Alba**

## Make-Ahead

- **Ragù**: Make 2-3 days ahead—it only improves
- **Pasta**: Make same day, keep between damp towels
- **Assembled**: Refrigerate up to 24 hours before baking (add 15 minutes to baking time)

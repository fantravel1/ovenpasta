## Bologna's Grand Celebration Pie

This is not everyday cooking—it's a project, a celebration, a statement. Fresh meat tortellini are folded in Parmigiano-enriched béchamel, then encased in hot water crust pastry and baked until golden.

The critical detail many miss: **SERVED COLD**. This is a picnic dish, meant to be eaten at room temperature, not hot from the oven.

## The Components

1. **Fresh meat tortellini** (or high-quality fresh from a pasta shop)
2. **Rich béchamel** with Parmigiano-Reggiano
3. **Hot water crust pastry** (sturdy enough to travel)

## Ingredients

### Hot Water Crust Pastry
- 500g all-purpose flour
- 150g lard (or butter)
- 200ml water
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 egg yolk for wash

### Tortellini Filling
- 800g fresh meat tortellini
- 100g Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated

### Parmigiano Béchamel
- 750ml whole milk
- 75g butter
- 75g flour
- 100g Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated
- Freshly grated nutmeg
- Salt and white pepper

## Instructions

### Make the Hot Water Crust

1. **Heat liquid**: Bring water and lard to a boil in a saucepan.

2. **Add to flour**: Pour hot liquid into flour and salt. Mix quickly with a wooden spoon.

3. **Knead briefly**: When cool enough to handle, knead until smooth. Work quickly—this dough becomes unworkable when cold.

4. **Divide**: Cut off ⅓ for the lid, keep both pieces warm under a towel.

5. **Line mold**: Press larger piece into a 9-inch springform pan while still warm, bringing dough up the sides.

### Make the Béchamel

1. **Melt butter**: In a saucepan over medium heat.

2. **Add flour**: Whisk in flour, cook 2 minutes.

3. **Add milk**: Gradually pour in warm milk, whisking constantly.

4. **Cook until thick**: About 10-12 minutes, stirring constantly.

5. **Add cheese**: Off heat, stir in Parmigiano, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.

6. **Cool**: Let béchamel cool to room temperature.

### Cook the Tortellini

1. **Boil briefly**: Cook tortellini in salted water until just done (they'll cook more in oven). Drain well.

2. **Cool**: Let tortellini cool to room temperature.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (180°C), then reduce to 320°F (160°C) for baking.

2. **Combine filling**: Gently fold tortellini into cooled béchamel. Add grated Parmigiano.

3. **Fill pastry**: Pour tortellini mixture into pastry-lined pan.

4. **Add lid**: Roll out remaining dough, place over filling. Crimp edges decoratively to seal.

5. **Vent**: Cut decorative slits in top.

6. **Egg wash**: Brush with beaten egg yolk.

7. **Bake**: Start at 350°F for 15 minutes, then reduce to 320°F and bake 1-1.25 hours until deep golden.

### The Critical Cooling

**Do not serve hot.** Let the pasticcio cool completely—at least 3-4 hours, or overnight refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before serving.

## Why Served Cold?

This is a **picnic dish**. The flavors and textures are designed to be enjoyed at room temperature:
- The pastry stays crisp, not soggy
- The béchamel sets to a sliceable consistency
- The flavors are more pronounced when not screaming hot
- It travels beautifully

## Historical Notes

This dish represents the height of Bolognese cucina povera transformed into celebration food. Tortellini—already a labor of love—are elevated further by the pastry encasement, creating something suitable for the most special occasions.

## Wine Pairing

Serve with:
- **Lambrusco** (sparkling, refreshing)
- **Pignoletto** (local white)
- **Sangiovese di Romagna**

## Make-Ahead

This dish is MEANT to be made ahead:
- **Tortellini**: Use fresh, cook same day
- **Béchamel**: Make day before
- **Pastry**: Make same day (doesn't keep well)
- **Assembled and baked**: Best made day before serving

## Serving Suggestions

- Slice like a pie
- Serve at room temperature
- Perfect for picnics, buffets, celebrations
- Accompany with a simple green salad

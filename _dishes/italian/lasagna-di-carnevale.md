## The Feast Before the Fast

**"Senza di essa, che Carnevale sarebbe?"** (Without it, what kind of Carnival would it be?)

This Neapolitan saying captures the essential role of Lasagna di Carnevale in the pre-Lenten celebrations. Served on **Martedì Grasso** (Fat Tuesday) and **Giovedì Grasso** (Fat Thursday), this is the ultimate indulgence before 40 days of Lenten fasting.

King Ferdinand II of Bourbon was nicknamed **"Re Lasagna"** for his devotion to this dish—a devotion shared by Neapolitans to this day.

## The Key Differences from Bolognese

| Neapolitan (Carnevale) | Bolognese |
|------------------------|-----------|
| Ricotta | Béchamel |
| Whole meat ragù + meatballs | Ground meat ragù |
| Hard-boiled eggs | No eggs |
| Fresh mozzarella | Only Parmigiano |
| Dry durum pasta | Fresh egg pasta |

## Ragù alla Napoletana

The ragù is the soul of this dish. It must "pippiare"—barely bubble—for 4-6 hours until the meat is falling apart and the sauce is deeply concentrated.

## Ingredients

### Ragù Napoletana
- 500g pork ribs
- 300g beef brasciole (rolled beef with filling)
- 200g Italian sausage
- 1 kg San Marzano tomatoes, crushed
- 200ml red wine
- 60g each: onion, carrot, celery
- Fresh basil
- 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tbsp lard (traditional)
- Salt

### Polpettine (Tiny Meatballs)
- 300g ground beef
- 50g Pecorino Romano
- 1 egg
- 50g bread soaked in milk
- Fresh parsley
- Salt and pepper
- Oil for frying

### Assembly
- 500g dry lasagna sheets (durum wheat)
- 500g fresh ricotta
- 300g fresh mozzarella, sliced
- 4 hard-boiled eggs, sliced
- 100g Pecorino Romano, grated
- 50g Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated

## Instructions

### Make the Ragù (Day Before)

1. **Brown meats**: Heat oil and lard in a large heavy pot. Brown ribs, brasciole, and sausages on all sides. Remove.

2. **Build base**: Add soffritto (onion, carrot, celery), cook until soft.

3. **Add wine**: Pour in wine, scrape up browned bits, reduce by half.

4. **Add tomatoes**: Stir in crushed tomatoes and basil.

5. **Return meats**: Nestle browned meats into sauce.

6. **Slow cook**: Cover and simmer at the barest bubble ("pippiare") for 4-6 hours. The meat should be falling apart.

7. **Cool**: Refrigerate overnight. The ragù improves dramatically.

### Make the Polpettine

1. **Mix**: Combine beef, Pecorino, egg, soaked bread, and parsley. Season.

2. **Form tiny balls**: Grape-sized, about 1.5cm diameter.

3. **Fry**: Cook in batches until golden. Drain and set aside.

### Day of Assembly

1. **Reheat ragù**: Gently warm. Remove whole meats (serve as second course). Keep sauce.

2. **Cook pasta**: Boil lasagna sheets until just pliable. Lay on towels.

3. **Prepare ricotta**: Season ricotta with salt and pepper.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (180°C).

2. **Start layering**: Spread ragù on bottom of deep baking dish.

3. **Build layers**:
   - Pasta sheets
   - Ragù
   - Dollops of ricotta
   - Polpettine
   - Mozzarella slices
   - Egg slices
   - Pecorino and Parmigiano

4. **Repeat**: 4-5 layers, ending with ragù and cheese.

5. **Bake**: 40-45 minutes until bubbling and golden.

### The Essential Rest

**"S'add a ripusà"** (it must rest)—30 minutes minimum before cutting. This is non-negotiable for clean slices and melded flavors.

## Carnival Traditions

Lasagna di Carnevale marks the peak of Carnival season. In Naples:
- **Giovedì Grasso** (Fat Thursday): First serving
- **Martedì Grasso** (Fat Tuesday): Final feast before Ash Wednesday
- **Ash Wednesday**: Begins 40 days of Lenten fasting

The dish represents abundance, celebration, and community—everything that will be set aside during Lent.

## Wine Pairing

- Aglianico del Taburno
- Taurasi
- Lacryma Christi del Vesuvio Rosso

## Make-Ahead

- **Ragù**: Essential to make 1-3 days ahead—it only improves
- **Polpettine**: Fry 2 days ahead
- **Hard-boil eggs**: Day before
- **Assembled**: Refrigerate overnight unbaked if needed, add 15 minutes baking time

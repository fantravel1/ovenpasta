## The Truth About Manicotti

Here's what most people don't know: **authentic manicotti uses crepes, not pasta tubes**. The ridged tubes sold as "manicotti" in American supermarkets are a modern convenience that many Italian-American nonnas would never recognize.

The word "manicotti" means "little sleeves" in Italian, referring to how the thin crepes wrap around the filling. This dish is a purely **Italian-American creation**—it doesn't exist in Italy by this name. Its closest Italian relative is crespelle (savory crepes).

## Manicotti vs. Cannelloni

| Feature | Manicotti (Italian-American) | Cannelloni (Italian) |
|---------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Wrapper** | Crepes or ridged tubes | Smooth pasta sheets |
| **Origin** | United States | Italy (Amalfi/Naples) |
| **Size** | Larger | Smaller, more refined |
| **Filling** | Ricotta-based | Meat or spinach-ricotta |

## Ingredients

### Crepes (Makes about 16)
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 4 large eggs
- 1 cup milk
- ½ cup water
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons melted butter, plus more for pan

### Ricotta Filling
- 2 lbs whole milk ricotta
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella
- 1 cup grated Parmesan
- 2 large eggs
- ¼ cup fresh parsley, minced
- ¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Assembly
- 4 cups marinara sauce
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella (for topping)
- ½ cup grated Parmesan (for topping)
- Fresh basil for garnish

## Instructions

### Make the Crepes

1. **Blend batter**: Combine flour, eggs, milk, water, salt, and melted butter in a blender. Blend until smooth. Let rest 15-30 minutes.

2. **Heat pan**: Use an 8-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat. Brush lightly with butter.

3. **Pour and swirl**: Pour about 3 tablespoons batter into pan, immediately tilting to coat bottom evenly.

4. **Cook**: Cook until bottom is lightly golden and edges lift easily, about 1 minute. Flip and cook 30 seconds more.

5. **Stack**: Place cooked crepes on a plate, stacking as you go. They won't stick.

### Make the Filling

1. **Drain ricotta**: If ricotta is very wet, drain in a fine-mesh strainer for 30 minutes.

2. **Combine**: Mix ricotta, mozzarella, Parmesan, eggs, parsley, and nutmeg. Season with salt and pepper.

3. **Taste and adjust**: The filling should be well-seasoned.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Spread sauce**: Ladle about 1 cup marinara sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.

3. **Fill crepes**: Place about ¼ cup filling along one edge of each crepe. Roll up into a cylinder.

4. **Arrange**: Place filled manicotti seam-side down in the dish, nestled close together.

5. **Top**: Cover with remaining marinara, then sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan.

6. **Cover and bake**: Cover with foil, bake 25 minutes.

7. **Uncover and finish**: Remove foil, bake 10-15 minutes more until cheese is melted and edges are bubbling.

8. **Rest**: Let stand 5 minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil.

## Why Crepes Are Superior

- **Tenderness**: Crepes are far more delicate than dried pasta tubes
- **No pre-cooking**: Fresh crepes don't need to be boiled first
- **Better filling distribution**: Crepes wrap snugly around filling without air gaps
- **Traditional**: This is how Italian-American grandmothers made it

## The Pasta Tube Shortcut

If using dried manicotti shells:
- Boil shells until just pliable (about 7 minutes)
- Cool in cold water, drain on towels
- Fill using a piping bag or small spoon
- Proceed with assembly

Note: Pasta tubes are more likely to break and harder to fill evenly, but they work in a pinch.

## Tips for Success

1. **Don't overfill**: Leave room to roll the crepes
2. **Seam side down**: Prevents unrolling during baking
3. **Plenty of sauce**: The crepes absorb sauce as they bake
4. **Drain the ricotta**: Watery ricotta makes soggy manicotti

## Make-Ahead Options

- **Crepes**: Make 2-3 days ahead, refrigerate between parchment
- **Filling**: Make 2 days ahead, refrigerate
- **Assembled**: Refrigerate unbaked up to 24 hours (add 10 minutes baking)
- **Freeze**: Assembled manicotti freeze well for up to 2 months

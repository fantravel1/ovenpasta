## Where Italy Meets Austria

In the far northeastern corner of Italy, where the Dolomites rise and the influence of the Habsburg Empire still echoes in the cuisine, Christmas Eve brings **Lasagne da Fornel**—a sweet-savory pasta unlike anything else in Italian cooking.

This is a dish of dried figs, golden raisins, walnuts, grated apples, and **poppy seeds**—an ingredient almost unknown in the rest of Italy but common in Austrian and German traditions.

## The Habsburg Connection

Friuli-Venezia Giulia was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1918. The poppy seeds in this dish—rare in Italian cooking—are a direct link to that Central European heritage.

The "Cramars," traveling peddlers who crossed the Alpine trade routes, brought back poppy seeds along with other goods, embedding them in local cuisine.

## Cultural Significance

- **Meatless Christmas Eve**: Catholic tradition of abstaining from meat before midnight
- **Vigilia feast**: Part of the elaborate Christmas Eve dinner
- **Mountain tradition**: Especially popular in the Dolomite valleys
- **Simple ingredients**: Reflects mountain pantry traditions

## Ingredients

### For the Pasta
- 400g fresh pasta sheets (or dried lasagna noodles)

### Sweet-Savory Mixture
- 150g dried figs, chopped
- 100g golden raisins
- 100g walnuts, roughly chopped
- 2 medium apples, peeled and grated
- 3 tablespoons poppy seeds
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- Zest of 1 lemon

### For Assembly
- 150g (1½ sticks) unsalted butter
- Fine breadcrumbs
- Powdered sugar for dusting (optional)

## Instructions

### Prepare the Filling

1. **Soak fruits**: Place chopped figs and raisins in warm water for 15 minutes. Drain well.

2. **Combine filling**: Mix soaked fruits with grated apple, walnuts, poppy seeds, sugar, cinnamon, and lemon zest.

3. **Let flavors meld**: Allow mixture to sit while you prepare pasta.

### Cook the Pasta

1. **Boil pasta**: Cook fresh pasta sheets in salted water until al dente. If using dried, follow package directions.

2. **Drain carefully**: Lay cooked pasta on clean kitchen towels.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (180°C).

2. **Prepare dish**: Butter a baking dish generously, coat with breadcrumbs.

3. **Melt butter**: Brown the butter slightly in a small saucepan—this adds nutty depth.

4. **Layer**: Place pasta sheets in dish, spread with fruit-nut mixture, drizzle with browned butter. Repeat layers.

5. **Top**: Finish with pasta, butter, and breadcrumbs.

6. **Bake**: 25-30 minutes until golden and fragrant.

### Serve

- Serve warm or at room temperature
- Dust with powdered sugar if desired
- Some families serve with warm melted butter on the side

## The Unique Flavor Profile

This isn't dessert—it's a main course that blurs the line between sweet and savory. The poppy seeds add an earthy, slightly bitter note that grounds the sweetness of the fruits. The browned butter contributes richness and nuttiness.

## Variations

- **With rum**: Soak fruits in dark rum instead of water
- **With honey**: Replace sugar with local mountain honey
- **With chocolate**: Some modern versions add dark chocolate shavings
- **With ricotta**: Dotted between layers for added richness

## Wine Pairing

- **Picolit** (Friuli's famous sweet wine)
- **Ramandolo**
- **Late harvest Gewürztraminer**

For those who prefer dry:
- **Ribolla Gialla**
- **Friulano**

## A Dish Apart

Lasagne da Fornel stands as proof that Italian cuisine is not monolithic. In the mountains where Italy meets Central Europe, a completely different pasta tradition evolved—one that embraces sweetness, celebrates preservation, and carries the memories of an empire that no longer exists.

## Make-Ahead

- **Filling**: Prepare a day ahead, refrigerate
- **Assembled**: Can be assembled morning of
- **Reheats well**: Gently warm in oven, adding a bit of butter

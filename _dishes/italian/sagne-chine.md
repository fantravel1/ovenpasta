## Calabria's Easter Treasure

"Sagne" comes from lasagne; "Chine" (chiena) means "filled" or "stuffed" in Calabrian dialect. This is the lasagna of Calabria's Easter celebrations, particularly beloved on **Pasquetta** (Easter Monday) when families gather for outdoor feasts.

Unlike Northern lasagnas with their béchamel, Sagne Chine uses generous layers of cheese to bind everything together—a distinctly Southern approach.

## What Makes It Unique

- **Tiny handmade meatballs** (marble-sized, about 1cm)
- **Artichokes** (fresh when in season, or frozen/jarred hearts)
- **Hard-boiled eggs**
- **Peas**
- **NO béchamel**—cheese layers replace the white sauce
- **Semolina pasta** (traditional, though egg pasta works)

## Ingredients

### Semolina Pasta
- 400g semolina flour
- Water as needed (about 200ml)
- Pinch of salt

### Tiny Meatballs (Polpettine)
- 300g mixed ground beef and pork
- 50g Pecorino Romano, grated
- 1 egg
- 50g stale bread, soaked in milk and squeezed
- Fresh parsley, minced
- Salt and pepper
- Olive oil for frying

### Tomato Sauce
- 500g tomato passata
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Fresh basil
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt

### Assembly
- 4 medium artichokes (or 1 can/jar artichoke hearts)
- 200g fresh or frozen peas
- 4 hard-boiled eggs, sliced
- 300g fresh mozzarella or provola, sliced
- 100g Pecorino Romano, grated
- Fresh parsley

## Instructions

### Make the Pasta

1. **Form dough**: Mound semolina, make a well, gradually add salted water. Knead until smooth.

2. **Rest**: Cover and rest 30 minutes.

3. **Roll**: Roll out thin and cut into wide strips or rectangles.

### Make the Meatballs

1. **Combine**: Mix beef, pork, Pecorino, egg, soaked bread, and parsley. Season.

2. **Form tiny balls**: Roll into **marble-sized balls** (about 1cm diameter)—this is essential for even cooking and distribution.

3. **Fry**: Fry in batches in olive oil until golden all over. Drain.

### Make the Sauce

1. **Sauté garlic** in olive oil until fragrant.

2. **Add tomatoes**: Pour in passata, add basil, season.

3. **Simmer**: Cook 20-25 minutes until slightly thickened.

### Prepare Vegetables

1. **Artichokes**: Clean fresh artichokes, slice thinly, sauté in olive oil until tender. (Or drain jarred artichokes and slice.)

2. **Peas**: Blanch fresh peas briefly (or thaw frozen).

3. **Eggs**: Slice hard-boiled eggs.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 325°F (165°C).

2. **Par-cook pasta**: Boil pasta sheets briefly until pliable, drain, lay on towels.

3. **Start layering**: Spread thin layer of sauce on bottom of deep baking dish.

4. **Build layers**:
   - Pasta sheets
   - Sauce
   - Meatballs
   - Artichokes
   - Peas
   - Egg slices
   - Mozzarella/provola slices
   - Pecorino

5. **Repeat**: Continue for 4-5 layers, ending with sauce and cheese.

6. **Bake**: 35-40 minutes until bubbling and cheese is golden.

7. **Rest**: Let stand 15 minutes before serving.

## The Easter Connection

In Calabria, Sagne Chine is inseparable from Easter celebrations. The eggs symbolize rebirth, the artichokes mark spring's arrival, and the elaborate preparation reflects the importance of the holiday.

Many families serve it on Pasquetta for outdoor picnics—it travels well and tastes wonderful at room temperature.

## Regional Variations

Different Calabrian towns have their own versions:
- Some add caciocavallo cheese
- Some include soppressata (Calabrian salami)
- Coastal areas might add anchovies
- Mountain villages may include mushrooms

## Tips for Authentic Results

1. **Marble-sized meatballs**: This is non-negotiable—larger meatballs don't distribute properly
2. **Don't rush the frying**: Each meatball should be golden all over
3. **Fresh artichokes when possible**: Their flavor is incomparable in spring
4. **No béchamel**: The cheese layers ARE your binder—use enough

## Wine Pairing

- **Cirò Rosso** (Calabria's most famous red)
- **Gaglioppo**
- **Greco di Bianco** (if preferring white)

## Make-Ahead

- **Meatballs**: Fry 2 days ahead, refrigerate
- **Sauce**: Make 3 days ahead
- **Artichokes**: Prepare day before
- **Assembled**: Can be assembled morning of, refrigerate, add baking time

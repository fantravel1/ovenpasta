# Instructions
instructions:
  - "Make the ragù: Render the pancetta in a heavy pot over medium heat. Add the soffritto and cook until softened, about 10 minutes."
  - "Add the ground beef, breaking it up into coarse pieces. Brown lightly, then add the wine and let it evaporate."
  - "Stir in the passata and tomato paste. Add enough broth to barely cover. Simmer very gently for 2-3 hours, adding broth as needed."
  - "In the final 30 minutes, add the milk and let it cook into the sauce. The ragù should be thick but not dry."
  - "Make the pasta: Blend the spinach into a paste. Mound the flour, make a well, add eggs and spinach. Knead 10-15 minutes until smooth and elastic."
  - "Rest the dough 30 minutes, then roll paper-thin. You should almost see your hand through it. Cut into sheets to fit your pan."
  - "Blanch pasta sheets 30 seconds in boiling salted water, then shock in ice water and lay on damp towels."
  - "Make the béchamel: Melt butter, whisk in flour, cook 2 minutes. Gradually add warm milk, whisking constantly. Season with nutmeg and salt. Cook until consistency of cream."
  - "Assemble: Butter your pan. Spread a thin layer of ragù, then béchamel. Add pasta sheets in a single layer."
  - "Continue layering: pasta, ragù (sparse), béchamel, Parmigiano. Build at least 6 layers, keeping each layer thin."
  - "Top layer should be béchamel and Parmigiano only."
  - "Bake at 350°F/180°C for 30-40 minutes until golden and bubbling. Broil briefly if needed for color."
  - "REST 15-20 MINUTES before cutting. This is essential for clean slices."

## The Definitive Italian Lasagna

Lasagna Bolognese stands at "the very peak" of the pasta pyramid, according to Marcella Hazan. This isn't just any layered pasta dish—it's the officially registered recipe of Bologna, documented by the Accademia Italiana della Cucina with the Bologna Chamber of Commerce on October 17, 1982 (updated April 20, 2023).

## What Makes It Authentic

There are strict requirements for true Lasagna Bolognese:

- **MUST use béchamel** (NOT ricotta—that's Southern Italian)
- **NO mozzarella** (only Parmigiano-Reggiano)
- **Green spinach pasta** (fresh, thin sheets)
- **Minimum 6 layers** with light application of each component
- **Slow-cooked ragù** (2-3+ hours with milk added in final 30 minutes)
- **NO garlic** in the ragù—considered too strong for the delicate béchamel

## The Science Behind the Technique

### Why So Many Thin Layers?

The magic of Bolognese lasagna lies in its delicate construction. Each impossibly thin pasta sheet creates separation between sauce layers, preventing the dish from becoming heavy. The result should be "light, almost airy."

### The Béchamel Ratio

Use the classic 1:1:10 ratio by weight:
- 100g butter
- 100g flour
- 1 liter milk

This creates a medium béchamel that's spreadable when warm. Marcella Hazan describes the ideal consistency as "like cream."

### Why Add Milk to the Ragù?

Adding milk in the final 30 minutes of cooking serves multiple purposes:
- Tenderizes the meat proteins
- Adds richness without heaviness
- Creates a more cohesive sauce

## The Resting Debate

**REST 15-20 MINUTES** before cutting—this is non-negotiable. Here's why:

- **Carryover cooking** raises internal temperature 5-10°F
- **Starches set** and firm up
- **Cheese firms** for cleaner slices

Many Bolognese cooks insist the dish actually tastes better the next day. Lidia Bastianich recommends: "Bake it and let it stand 3 to 4 hours. Cut the lasagna into portions, rewarm it in the oven."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using ricotta** — That's Neapolitan, not Bolognese
2. **Adding mozzarella** — The only cheese should be Parmigiano-Reggiano
3. **Thick pasta sheets** — They should be paper-thin
4. **Cutting too soon** — Patience creates clean portions
5. **Skipping the milk in ragù** — It's essential for authentic flavor

## Make-Ahead Tips

- **Ragù improves overnight** — Make it a day ahead
- **Assemble up to 2 days ahead** — Add 20 minutes baking time if cold from refrigerator
- **Freeze assembled** — Up to 3 months; thaw overnight before baking

## Wine Pairing

Traditional pairings from the region:
- **Lambrusco di Sorbara** — The classic local choice
- **Sangiovese di Romagna** — Regional red
- **Barbera d'Alba** — Bright acidity cuts through richness

## Origin & History

"Lagana" dates to ancient Rome, but the modern layered version emerged in Emilia-Romagna. The dish represents Bologna's nickname "La Grassa" (The Fat City) and is essential for Sunday lunch, Christmas, and Easter celebrations.

The official registration protects both the ragù recipe (1982) and the complete dish preparation, ensuring this culinary treasure maintains its authentic character for future generations.

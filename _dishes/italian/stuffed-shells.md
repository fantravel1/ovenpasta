## The Perfect Weeknight Pasta

Stuffed shells offer all the comfort of lasagna with a fraction of the effort. Each shell becomes its own perfect package of creamy ricotta filling, surrounded by tangy marinara and topped with melted mozzarella.

While the dish is Italian-American in its current form, it descends from the Italian tradition of pasta ripiena (stuffed pasta) that includes everything from tortellini to agnolotti.

## Critical Techniques

1. **Undercook pasta** by 1 minute—shells expand when baked
2. **Cool shells properly**—toss with oil immediately after draining
3. **Drain ricotta** if watery—excess moisture makes soggy shells
4. **Keep sauce thin**—pasta absorbs liquid during baking
5. **Use a piping bag** for faster, neater filling

## Ingredients

### Pasta
- 24 jumbo pasta shells (conchiglioni)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

### Ricotta-Spinach Filling
- 2 lbs (900g) whole milk ricotta
- 300g frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed very dry
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella (divided)
- 1 cup grated Parmesan (divided)
- 2 large eggs
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ teaspoon nutmeg
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh basil, chopped (optional)

### For Assembly
- 4 cups marinara sauce
- Fresh basil for garnish

## Instructions

### Prepare the Shells

1. **Boil pasta**: Cook shells in well-salted water until 1 minute LESS than package directions. They should be pliable but still firm.

2. **Drain and oil**: Drain shells, immediately toss with olive oil to prevent sticking.

3. **Cool**: Spread shells on a baking sheet in a single layer to cool.

### Make the Filling

1. **Drain ricotta** if necessary: Place in a fine-mesh strainer over a bowl for 30 minutes if very wet.

2. **Squeeze spinach**: Thawed spinach should be squeezed in a clean towel until almost no moisture remains.

3. **Combine**: Mix ricotta, spinach, 1 cup mozzarella, ½ cup Parmesan, eggs, garlic, and nutmeg.

4. **Season**: Add salt and pepper to taste—filling should be well-seasoned.

5. **Optional**: Transfer to a piping bag or zip-lock bag with corner cut off.

### Assemble and Bake

1. **Preheat oven** to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Prepare dish**: Spread 1 cup marinara sauce on bottom of 9x13 inch baking dish.

3. **Fill shells**: Pipe or spoon filling into each shell, about 2 tablespoons each.

4. **Arrange**: Place filled shells open-side up in the dish, nestled close together.

5. **Top**: Spoon remaining marinara over and between shells. Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan.

6. **Cover**: Tent loosely with foil.

7. **Bake covered**: 20 minutes.

8. **Uncover**: Remove foil, bake 10-15 minutes more until cheese is melted and edges are bubbling.

9. **Rest**: Let stand 5 minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil.

## Filling Variations

### Classic Meat Filling
- 1 lb Italian sausage, removed from casing and browned

- 1 egg
- Fresh parsley

### Three-Cheese Filling
- 2 lbs ricotta

### Butternut Squash Filling

## Tips for Perfect Shells

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Shells break | Undercook by 2 minutes |
| Filling falls out | Let shells cool completely |
| Dry result | Use more sauce, don't over-bake |
| Watery | Drain ricotta and spinach well |

## Make-Ahead Options

- **Fill shells**: Arrange in dish, cover, refrigerate up to 24 hours. Add sauce just before baking.
- **Freeze unbaked**: Freeze filled shells on sheet pan, then transfer to bags. Bake from frozen, adding 20-25 minutes.
- **Freeze baked**: Cool completely, freeze up to 3 months. Thaw overnight before reheating.

## Palermo's Showstopper

When Palermitani say "timballo," they mean THIS dish—a spectacular construction of ring-shaped pasta, rich meat ragù, peas, cheese, all encased in overlapping fried eggplant slices. When unmolded, it reveals a perfect drum shape that's as impressive as it is delicious.

The word "timballo" comes from the French "timbale" (drum), and this dish delivers on that promise. It's traditional for Sunday lunch, beach picnics (served at room temperature), and the August 15th Ferragosto celebration.

## Ingredients

### For the Ragù
- 450g mixed ground beef and pork
- 150g frozen peas
- 400g tomato passata
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 150ml red wine
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- Fresh basil
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper

### For the Eggplant Casing
- 3 large eggplants
- Vegetable oil for frying
- Salt

### For the Pasta
- 340g Anelli Siciliani (ring-shaped pasta)
- 125g fresh mozzarella, cubed
- 100g caciocavallo or provolone, grated
- 50g Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated

### Equipment
- 9-inch springform pan

## Instructions

### Prepare the Eggplant

1. **Slice eggplants** lengthwise, about 5mm thick.

2. **Salt and drain**: Layer slices in a colander, salt generously, let drain 30-60 minutes.

3. **Pat dry** and fry in batches in vegetable oil until golden on both sides.

4. **Drain** on paper towels.

### Make the Ragù

1. **Sauté aromatics**: Cook onion in olive oil until softened. Add garlic, cook 1 minute.

2. **Brown meat**: Add ground meat, break up, cook until no longer pink.

3. **Add wine**: Pour in wine, let it reduce by half.

4. **Add tomatoes**: Stir in passata and tomato paste. Season with salt, pepper, basil.

5. **Add peas**: Stir in frozen peas.

6. **Simmer**: Cook gently for 45 minutes until thick and rich.

### Cook the Pasta

1. **Boil pasta** for exactly **half the package time**. It will finish cooking in the oven.

2. **Drain** and toss with half the ragù to coat.

### Assemble the Timballo

1. **Preheat oven** to 400°F (205°C).

2. **Oil the springform**: Generously coat bottom and sides.

3. **Line with eggplant**: Arrange fried eggplant slices in overlapping pattern on bottom and up the sides, leaving overhang to fold over the top later.

4. **Add first layer**: Spread some ragù on bottom, add a layer of dressed pasta.

5. **Add cheese**: Scatter mozzarella cubes, caciocavallo, and some Parmigiano.

6. **Repeat**: Continue layering pasta, ragù, and cheeses until pan is filled.

7. **Top and fold**: Add final layer of ragù and cheese, then fold overhanging eggplant over the top.

8. **Cover**: Place a piece of foil over the top.

9. **Bake**: 45-50 minutes until heated through and bubbling at edges.

### The Critical Rest

**REST MINIMUM 15 MINUTES** before attempting to unmold. This is non-negotiable—the timballo needs time to set so it holds its shape.

### Unmold

1. Remove foil and let cool slightly.

2. Run a knife around the edges.

3. Place serving platter over springform.

4. Flip confidently.

5. Release springform sides.

6. Reveal your masterpiece.

## The Non-Negotiables

- **ONLY anelletti pasta**: These small rings are unique to Sicily and essential to the dish's identity
- **Must be round**: The drum shape defines a timballo
- **Eggplant casing**: This creates the dramatic reveal when unmolded
- **Peas in the ragù**: Traditional and non-negotiable

## History & Origin

The timballo traces to Arab emirs who ruled Sicily in the 9th century. They introduced elaborate layered dishes and the concept of dramatic presentation. The Sicilian timballo evolved over centuries, becoming the baroque construction we know today.

In Palermo, this isn't just food—it's theater. The unmolding of a timballo at a family gathering is a moment of drama and anticipation.

## Serving Suggestions

- **Hot**: Fresh from the oven for Sunday lunch
- **Room temperature**: Traditional for beach picnics and outdoor gatherings
- **Never refrigerator-cold**: Always bring to at least room temperature

## Make-Ahead Tips

- **Ragù**: Make 2-3 days ahead
- **Fry eggplant**: Day before, refrigerate between paper towels
- **Assembled**: Can be assembled and refrigerated unbaked up to 24 hours (add 15 minutes baking time)

## Chef's Notes

- If you can't find anelletti, ditalini is the closest substitute—but true Palermitani would insist on the real thing
- The half-cooked pasta method prevents mushiness—trust the process
- A well-rested timballo slices cleanly; a rushed one crumbles

## Le Marche's Crown Jewel

Vincigrassi is not just another lasagna—it's a statement of regional pride and culinary sophistication. What sets it apart is the **offal-enriched ragù** featuring chicken livers, hearts, and sweetbreads, combined with pasta dough enriched with Vin Santo or Marsala wine.

The dish carries the mystique of two origin stories: one claims it was named for Austrian General **Alfred von Windisch-Grätz** during the 1799 Siege of Ancona. The other, more compelling theory traces it to **"Princisgras"** (Prince's Grease)—a recipe documented in Antonio Nebbia's 1779 cookbook "Il Cuoco Maceratese."

## Ingredients

### Ragù with Offal
- 200g chicken livers, cleaned and chopped
- 100g chicken hearts, trimmed and halved
- 100g sweetbreads, blanched and cubed
- 300g mixed ground beef and pork
- 150g pancetta, diced
- 200ml dry white wine
- 400g tomato passata
- 1 medium onion, finely diced
- 1 carrot, finely diced
- 1 celery stalk, finely diced
- Fresh marjoram (signature herb)
- Beef or chicken broth as needed
- Salt and pepper

### Vin Santo Pasta
- 400g 00 flour
- 4 large eggs
- 3 tbsp Vin Santo or Marsala wine
- Pinch of salt

### Béchamel
- 1 liter whole milk
- 100g butter
- 100g flour
- Freshly grated nutmeg
- Salt to taste

### Assembly
- 150g Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated
- Fresh white or black truffle (Le Marche produces both)
- Butter for the dish

## Instructions

### Make the Pasta Dough

1. Mound flour on work surface, create a well in center.

2. Add eggs, Vin Santo, and salt to well.

3. Gradually incorporate flour, kneading until smooth and elastic (10 minutes).

4. Wrap in plastic and rest 30 minutes.

5. Roll very thin and cut into irregular squares (traditional style) or standard rectangles.

### Make the Ragù

1. **Sauté pancetta** until fat renders and edges crisp.

2. **Add soffritto**: Cook onion, carrot, and celery until softened.

3. **Brown the offal**: Add chicken livers, hearts, and sweetbreads. Cook until just colored but still pink inside.

4. **Add ground meats**: Brown well, breaking up with a spoon.

5. **Deglaze**: Pour in white wine, scrape up browned bits, reduce by half.

6. **Add tomato**: Stir in passata and fresh marjoram.

7. **Simmer**: Cook gently for 2 hours, adding broth if needed. Season well.

### Make the Béchamel

1. Melt butter in saucepan over medium heat.

2. Whisk in flour, cook 2 minutes without browning.

3. Gradually add warm milk, whisking constantly.

4. Cook until thick enough to coat a spoon (10-12 minutes).

5. Season with nutmeg and salt.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (180°C).

2. **Par-cook pasta**: Boil sheets briefly (30 seconds), shock in ice water, lay on towels.

3. **Layer**: Butter dish, add pasta, ragù, béchamel, Parmigiano. Repeat for **minimum 7 layers**.

4. **Finish**: End with béchamel and generous Parmigiano.

5. **Bake**: 45-50 minutes until golden and bubbling.

6. **Rest**: 15 minutes before serving.

7. **Truffle**: Shave fresh truffle generously over each portion.

## The Distinctive Elements

- **Offal is non-negotiable**: The chicken livers, hearts, and sweetbreads give Vincigrassi its characteristic richness
- **Vin Santo in the pasta**: This sweet wine adds complexity and a subtle golden color
- **Marjoram, not basil**: This herb is the signature of Le Marche cuisine
- **Minimum 7 layers**: Traditional Vincigrassi is a tall, impressive construction
- **Fresh truffle**: Le Marche is famous for both white (Acqualagna) and black truffles

## History & Cultural Significance

Every June, the town of **Monte Urano** hosts a Sagra (festival) dedicated to Vincigrassi. The dish represents the agricultural wealth of Le Marche—a region that produces some of Italy's finest truffles, wine, and farm products.

Whether named for an Austrian general or for princes, this lasagna was always noble food. The use of offal—prized for its complex flavors and nutritional density—speaks to an era when nothing was wasted and everything was elevated.

## Wine Pairing

- **Rosso Conero** (local red, medium-bodied)
- **Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi** (if preferring white)
- **Lacrima di Morro d'Alba** (aromatic local red)

## Chef's Notes

- If sweetbreads are unavailable, increase chicken livers
- The pasta dough can also use Marsala if Vin Santo isn't available
- Make the ragù a day ahead—the flavors meld beautifully
- Don't skip the truffle—it transforms the dish from excellent to transcendent

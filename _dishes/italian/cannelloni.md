## True Italian Cannelloni

Cannelloni (meaning "large reeds") features smooth pasta sheets rolled around a filling—this is what distinguishes it from American manicotti. The pasta is thin, delicate, and wraps seamlessly around rich meat or spinach-ricotta fillings.

First documented as "maccheroni ripieni" (stuffed pasta) in 1770, the term "cannelloni" emerged in the early 20th century. Origins are disputed between Naples and the Amalfi Coast, but the dish has become beloved across all of Italy.

## Regional Variations

- **Emilia-Romagna**: Filled with ragù Bolognese
- **Naples/Sorrentina**: Mozzarella, sheep's ricotta, prosciutto
- **Rome**: Rich meat sauce with multiple meats
- **Umbria**: WHITE sauce only—béchamel with no tomato

## Ingredients

### Fresh Pasta
- 300g 00 flour
- 3 large eggs
- Pinch of salt
- Semolina for dusting

### Meat Filling (Emilia-Romagna Style)
- 400g ragù Bolognese (or ground beef/pork mixture)
- 200g ricotta
- 1 egg
- 50g Parmesan, grated
- Nutmeg, salt, pepper

### OR Spinach-Ricotta Filling (Vegetarian)
- 500g spinach, cooked and squeezed dry
- 500g ricotta
- 100g Parmesan, grated
- 2 eggs
- Nutmeg, salt, pepper

### Sauces
- 2 cups béchamel sauce
- 2 cups tomato sauce (or double béchamel for white version)
- 100g Parmesan, grated

## Instructions

### Make the Pasta

1. **Form dough**: Mound flour, make well, add eggs and salt. Knead until smooth (10 minutes).

2. **Rest**: Wrap and rest 30 minutes.

3. **Roll thin**: Using pasta machine, roll to thinnest setting (about 1mm).

4. **Cut rectangles**: Cut into 4x6 inch rectangles.

5. **Par-cook**: Boil pasta briefly (1 minute), shock in ice water, lay on oiled towels.

### Make the Filling

**For Meat Filling:**
1. Combine cooled ragù with ricotta, egg, and Parmesan.
2. Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
3. Mix well but don't overwork.

**For Spinach-Ricotta:**
1. Finely chop the cooked spinach.
2. Combine with ricotta, Parmesan, eggs.
3. Season generously with nutmeg, salt, and pepper.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Spread base**: Spread thin layer of béchamel on bottom of baking dish.

3. **Fill and roll**: Place 2-3 tablespoons filling along one short end of each pasta rectangle. Roll up snugly.

4. **Arrange**: Place cannelloni seam-side down in dish, close together but not squished.

5. **Sauce**: Spoon tomato sauce in ribbons, then drizzle béchamel over all. Sprinkle with Parmesan.

6. **Bake**: 30-40 minutes until golden and bubbling.

7. **Rest**: 5-10 minutes before serving.

## The Two-Sauce Tradition

Classic cannelloni features BOTH tomato sauce and béchamel—the red-and-white pattern is traditional and beautiful. However, Umbrian-style (alla bianca) uses only béchamel with sage-infused butter.

## Béchamel Recipe

- 50g butter
- 50g flour
- 500ml warm milk
- Nutmeg, salt

Melt butter, whisk in flour, cook 2 minutes. Gradually add warm milk, whisk constantly until thick. Season.

## Tips for Perfect Cannelloni

1. **Roll pasta thin**: Thick pasta makes heavy, doughy cannelloni
2. **Don't overfill**: Leave room for the pasta to seal
3. **Snug arrangement**: Cannelloni should touch; too much space allows drying
4. **Plenty of sauce**: Cover completely so edges don't crisp
5. **Rest before serving**: Allows flavors to meld and filling to set

## Make-Ahead

- **Pasta**: Make same day, keep covered
- **Fillings**: Make 1-2 days ahead, refrigerate
- **Assembled**: Refrigerate unbaked up to 24 hours
- **Freeze**: Assembled cannelloni freeze beautifully for up to 3 months

## Wine Pairing

- **With meat**: Chianti Classico, Rosso di Montalcino
- **With spinach-ricotta**: Verdicchio, Soave

## Brazil's Italian Soul

**30 million Brazilians** have Italian ancestry—the largest Italian diaspora outside Italy. Macarronada de Forno reflects this heritage, adapted with Brazilian ingredients and sensibilities.

## Traditionally Served

Sundays after Catholic mass. Brazilian families gather for a leisurely almoço (lunch) featuring this comforting baked pasta.

## Brazilian Touches

Things that would scandalize Italian traditionalists:
- **Green olives** (scandalous!)
- **Sweet corn** (common addition)
- **Pasta cooked softer** than al dente
- **Requeijão** instead of ricotta

## Ingredients

### Ragù
- 450g ground beef
- 150g bacon, diced
- 1 large onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 400g tomato sauce
- 200g crushed tomatoes
- 1 cup beef broth
- 1 bay leaf
- Fresh parsley
- Salt and pepper

### Assembly
- 500g penne or rigatoni
- 200g requeijão (or cream cheese)
- 200g mozzarella, shredded
- 50g Parmesan, grated
- Green olives, sliced (optional)
- Sweet corn kernels (optional)

## Instructions

### Make the Ragù

1. **Cook bacon**: Render fat from diced bacon until crispy. Remove bacon.

2. **Brown beef**: In the bacon fat, cook ground beef until browned.

3. **Add aromatics**: Add onion and garlic. Cook until soft.

4. **Add tomatoes**: Stir in tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, and broth.

5. **Season**: Add bay leaf and parsley.

6. **Simmer**: Cook 1-1.5 hours until rich and thick. Return bacon.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (175°C).

2. **Cook pasta**: Boil until just done (Brazilians prefer it softer). Drain.

3. **Combine**: Mix pasta with ragù.

4. **Layer**: Transfer half to baking dish. Dot with requeijão. Add olives/corn if using.

5. **Repeat**: Add remaining pasta, more requeijão, mozzarella, and Parmesan.

6. **Bake**: 30-35 minutes until golden.

## What Is Requeijão?

**Requeijão cremoso** is Brazilian cream cheese—smooth, slightly tangy, sold in jars or cups. It melts beautifully into hot pasta. Substitute: cream cheese mixed with a splash of milk.

## The Olive Debate

Some Brazilian families insist on green olives. Others would never. It's a matter of family tradition—just like every food debate in Brazil.

## Serving

Served with a simple salad (alface e tomate—lettuce and tomato) and often followed by café com leite (coffee with milk) and something sweet.

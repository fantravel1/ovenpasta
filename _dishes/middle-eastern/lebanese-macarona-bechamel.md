history: |
  Lebanese Macarona Bechamel is affectionately known as the "poor man's mac and cheese" because it
  achieves rich, creamy comfort without expensive cheese. The dish reflects Lebanon's history of
  French culinary influence during the mandate period (1920-1943), when béchamel sauce became
  integrated into Levantine cooking.

  Unlike its Egyptian and Greek cousins that feature spiced meat, the Lebanese version celebrates
  simplicity. It became a staple of home cooking, particularly during times when meat was scarce
  or during meatless religious observances. The crispy panko topping is a more modern addition
  that has become essential to the dish's identity.

serving_suggestions:
  - "Serve as a main course with a fresh fattoush salad"
  - "Excellent alongside grilled chicken or kebabs"
  - "Pair with pickled turnips (lift) for tang and crunch"
  - "Serve with a squeeze of lemon for brightness"

make_ahead: |
  Can be assembled up to 24 hours ahead and refrigerated. Add the panko topping just before baking
  for maximum crispness. Add 10 minutes to baking time if cold. Leftovers reheat well covered with
  foil at 350°F for 20 minutes.

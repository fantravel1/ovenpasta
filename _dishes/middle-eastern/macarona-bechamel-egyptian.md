## Egypt's Comfort Food

Macarona Bechamel holds a special place in Egyptian cuisine—appearing at Ramadan iftar meals, Eid celebrations, and every significant family gathering. Its origins trace to French-trained chefs in the khedival palace kitchens of mid-19th century Egypt.

The recipe was standardized through **Kitab Abla Nazira**, Egypt's most influential cookbook.

## Key Differences from Greek Pastitsio

- Uses **cinnamon** in meat sauce (distinctive Egyptian touch)
- Béchamel made with milk AND **chicken broth**
- Traditional versions have **NO cheese**
- Often uses penne rather than tubular pastitsio pasta

## Ingredients

### Spiced Meat Sauce
- 450g ground beef
- 1 large onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 400g tomato sauce
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon allspice
- ½ teaspoon cumin
- Salt and pepper
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

### Egyptian Béchamel
- 75g butter
- 75g flour
- 500ml whole milk
- 250ml chicken broth
- ½ teaspoon nutmeg
- Salt and white pepper

### Assembly
- 500g penne pasta
- 2 eggs, beaten (optional, for richer version)
- Vegetable oil for the pan

## Instructions

### Make the Meat Sauce

1. **Brown beef**: Heat oil, cook beef with onion until browned.

2. **Add garlic**: Cook 1 minute.

3. **Spice it**: Add cinnamon, allspice, and cumin. Stir until fragrant.

4. **Add tomatoes**: Pour in tomato sauce. Simmer 15-20 minutes until thick. Season.

### Make the Béchamel

1. **Make roux**: Melt butter, whisk in flour. Cook 2 minutes without browning.

2. **Add liquids**: Gradually add milk and broth, whisking constantly.

3. **Cook**: Stir until thick, about 10 minutes.

4. **Season**: Add nutmeg, salt, white pepper.

5. **Optional**: Once cooled slightly, whisk in beaten eggs for richer result.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (180°C).

2. **Cook pasta**: Boil penne until al dente. Drain.

3. **Oil the dish**: Coat a 9x13 baking dish with oil.

4. **Layer**: Mix pasta with meat sauce. Transfer to dish. Pour béchamel evenly over top.

5. **Bake**: 35-40 minutes until golden brown and set.

6. **Rest**: Let stand 15-20 minutes before cutting into squares.

## Ramadan & Eid

During Ramadan, Macarona Bechamel is a frequent iftar (fast-breaking meal) dish. Its protein-rich, carb-heavy composition makes it ideal for replenishing energy after a day of fasting.

At Eid al-Fitr (end of Ramadan) and Eid al-Adha, it appears alongside other celebratory dishes.

## Traditional vs. Modern

| Traditional | Modern |
|-------------|--------|
| No cheese | Often includes cheese |
| Broth in béchamel | Sometimes all milk |
| Simple spicing | More complex seasonings |

## Serving

Cut into squares like a cake. Serve warm or at room temperature. Often accompanied by a simple cucumber-tomato salad.

## Syria's Yogurt Pasta

While Egyptian cuisine favors béchamel, Syrian cooking embraces yogurt—**laban**. This tangy, garlicky pasta dish is comfort food across the Levant, related to Turkish "Yalancı Mantı" (fake manti dumplings).

## Critical Warning

**Store components SEPARATELY**—yogurt clumps and hardens when pre-mixed with pasta. Assemble just before serving.

## Ingredients

### Yogurt Sauce
- 500g full-fat plain yogurt
- 3 cloves garlic, minced to a paste with salt
- 2 tablespoons tahini (optional)
- Salt to taste

### Spiced Meat Topping
- 300g ground beef or lamb
- 1 small onion, diced
- 1 teaspoon baharat (seven spices)
- ½ teaspoon cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon allspice
- Salt and pepper
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

### Garlic Butter
- 60g butter
- 2 cloves garlic, sliced
- 1 teaspoon dried mint
- 1 teaspoon sumac

### Assembly
- 400g short pasta (shells, penne, or elbows)
- Pine nuts, toasted
- Extra dried mint and sumac

## Instructions

### Make the Meat Topping

1. **Brown meat**: Heat oil, cook meat with onion until well browned.

2. **Season**: Add baharat, cinnamon, allspice. Cook 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper.

### Make the Yogurt Sauce

1. **Combine**: Whisk yogurt with garlic paste and tahini (if using). Season.

2. **Thin if needed**: Add a splash of water for pourable consistency.

### Make the Garlic Butter

1. **Brown butter**: Melt butter over medium heat until golden.

2. **Add garlic**: Sizzle garlic slices briefly.

3. **Add spices**: Remove from heat, stir in dried mint and sumac.

### Assemble (Just Before Serving)

1. **Cook pasta**: Boil until al dente. Drain (reserve some pasta water).

2. **Plate**: Divide warm pasta among bowls.

3. **Add yogurt**: Top each portion with yogurt sauce.

4. **Add meat**: Spoon spiced meat over yogurt.

5. **Drizzle butter**: Pour garlic butter over everything.

6. **Garnish**: Sprinkle with pine nuts, extra mint, and sumac.

## The Seven Spices (Baharat)

This Middle Eastern spice blend typically contains:
- Black pepper
- Cinnamon
- Coriander
- Cumin
- Cardamom
- Cloves
- Nutmeg

## Storage & Leftovers

Keep components separate:
- Pasta in one container
- Yogurt in another
- Meat in a third

Reheat pasta and meat, assemble fresh with cold or room-temperature yogurt.

## Vegetarian Version

Skip the meat entirely. Top with extra pine nuts, crispy fried onions, and a generous drizzle of the garlic-mint butter.

## Iraq's Golden Pasta

What sets Iraqi macaroni apart is its distinctive **golden color** from turmeric and its aromatic spice blend. Every family has their own variation, but the turmeric is a constant.

## The Distinctive Spices

- **Baharat** (seven spices)
- **Turmeric** (gives golden color)
- **Cardamom**
- **Curry powder** (in some families)

## Ingredients

### Meat Sauce
- 450g ground beef
- 1 large onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 400g tomato sauce
- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- 1 teaspoon baharat
- ½ teaspoon cardamom
- ½ teaspoon cinnamon
- Salt and pepper
- Vegetable oil

### Béchamel
- 60g butter
- 60g flour
- 750ml milk
- ¼ teaspoon turmeric
- Salt and white pepper

### Assembly
- 500g penne or rigatoni
- 150g mozzarella, shredded (modern addition)

### Iraqi Salad (Served on Top)
- 2 cucumbers, diced
- 3 tomatoes, diced
- 1 small onion, thinly sliced
- Fresh parsley
- Lemon juice
- Olive oil
- Salt

## Instructions

### Make the Meat Sauce

1. **Brown meat**: Cook beef with onion until browned.

2. **Add spices**: Stir in garlic, turmeric, baharat, cardamom, and cinnamon. Cook 1 minute.

3. **Add tomatoes**: Pour in tomato sauce. Simmer 15 minutes. Season.

### Make the Béchamel

1. **Make roux**: Melt butter, whisk in flour and turmeric.

2. **Add milk**: Gradually pour in milk, whisking constantly until thick.

3. **Season**: Add salt and pepper.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (180°C).

2. **Cook pasta**: Boil until al dente. Drain.

3. **Combine**: Mix pasta with meat sauce.

4. **Layer**: Transfer to baking dish. Pour béchamel over top. Add cheese.

5. **Bake**: 30-35 minutes until golden.

### Make the Salad

1. **Combine**: Toss cucumbers, tomatoes, onion, and parsley.

2. **Dress**: Add lemon juice, olive oil, and salt.

## The Salad Tradition

In Iraqi homes, the fresh salad isn't served on the side—it's **poured directly over** the hot macaroni. The contrast of hot, creamy pasta with cold, crisp vegetables is essential.

## Family Variations

Every Iraqi family has their version:
- Some add curry powder
- Some use lamb instead of beef
- Some include peas in the sauce
- Some skip the béchamel entirely

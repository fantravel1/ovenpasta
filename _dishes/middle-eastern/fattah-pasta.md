history: |
  Fattah (from the Arabic 'to break bread') is one of Egypt's most ancient dishes, with roots
  stretching back to the Fatimid dynasty. It is THE celebratory dish of Egypt, as essential to
  Eid al-Adha as turkey is to American Thanksgiving.

  The dish represents abundance and generosity—the layering of bread, rice, pasta, and meat
  demonstrates hospitality and celebration. During Eid al-Adha (the Festival of Sacrifice),
  fattah is prepared with the freshly sacrificed lamb, making it deeply connected to religious
  observance. It's also essential for Coptic Christmas, weddings, and welcoming new babies.

  The vermicelli (shaaria) in the rice is a distinctly Egyptian touch, adding texture and a
  toasted, nutty flavor that has become inseparable from the dish's identity.

cultural_significance: |
  Fattah is more than food—it's a ritual. The layering represents community and sharing, with
  each component contributing to the whole. The dish is traditionally served on a large communal
  platter, emphasizing togetherness. During Eid, families gather to prepare and share fattah,
  often distributing portions to neighbors and those in need.

serving_suggestions:
  - "Serve family-style on a large deep platter"
  - "Provide extra garlic-vinegar sauce on the side"
  - "Accompany with pickled vegetables and fresh herbs"
  - "Traditional to serve with cold yogurt drink (laban)"

make_ahead: |
  The meat can be cooked a day ahead—the broth actually improves overnight. Rice and sauces can
  be made a few hours ahead. However, the bread should be fried and the dish assembled just before
  serving to maintain the textural contrast between crispy bread and tender meat.

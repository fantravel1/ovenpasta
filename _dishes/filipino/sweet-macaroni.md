## The Sweet Pasta of the Philippines

Filipino pasta is **sweet**—and that's not an accident. It reflects centuries of cultural influences and WWII-era adaptations. To foreigners, it's surprising. To Filipinos, it's home.

## The Banana Ketchup Story

During WWII, tomato shortages led food technologist **Maria Orosa** to develop **banana ketchup** as a substitute. Made from bananas, vinegar, sugar, and spices with red food coloring, it became a Philippine pantry staple.

Popular brands: UFC, Jufran, Mafran

## Why It's Sweet

Legend has it that during American occupation, General Douglas MacArthur's staff created sweet pasta when Italian ingredients weren't available. Whether true or not, Filipinos embraced the sweetness.

## Ingredients

### Sweet Meat Sauce
- 450g ground beef or pork
- 200g Filipino red hot dogs, sliced
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 400g tomato sauce
- 200g banana ketchup
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 cup beef broth
- Salt and pepper

### Assembly
- 500g elbow macaroni
- 250g processed cheese (Cheez Whiz or Velveeta)
- 100g cheddar cheese, grated
- 2 tablespoons butter

## Instructions

### Make the Sweet Sauce

1. **Brown meat**: Cook ground beef/pork until browned. Drain excess fat.

2. **Sauté aromatics**: Add onion and garlic. Cook until soft.

3. **Add hot dogs**: Stir in sliced red hot dogs.

4. **Add sauces**: Pour in tomato sauce, banana ketchup, and broth.

5. **Sweeten**: Add sugar. Taste and adjust sweetness.

6. **Simmer**: Cook 30-45 minutes until thick. Season.

### Assemble

1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (175°C).

2. **Cook macaroni**: Boil until al dente. Drain.

3. **Add cheese to sauce**: Stir processed cheese into hot meat sauce until melted.

4. **Combine**: Toss pasta with sauce.

5. **Transfer**: Pour into buttered baking dish.

6. **Top**: Sprinkle cheddar and dot with butter.

7. **Bake**: 25-30 minutes until cheese is melted and edges bubble.

## Cultural Significance

Filipino sweet macaroni appears at:
- **Children's birthday parties** (essential)
- **Christmas Noche Buena** (Christmas Eve feast)
- **Town fiestas**
- **Family gatherings**
- **Jollibee** (Philippines' beloved fast-food chain)

## The Red Hot Dogs

Filipino hot dogs are bright red (food coloring) and slightly sweeter than American versions. Brands like Purefoods Tender Juicy are iconic. If unavailable, use American hot dogs with a pinch of sugar.

## Processed Cheese Is Traditional

This isn't the place for artisanal cheese. Cheez Whiz, Velveeta, or Eden cheese (Filipino brand) are traditional and create the expected flavor and texture.

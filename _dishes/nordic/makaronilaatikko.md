## Finland's Everyday Hero

Documented as early as **1915** in Finnish literature, Makaronilaatikko remains **Finland's second most popular everyday dinner** according to a 2010 survey. Originally a meatless Christmas dish, it evolved to include ground beef.

## The Non-Negotiable

**ALWAYS served with ketchup**—this is mandatory for authenticity. Lingonberry jam and pickled beetroot are traditional accompaniments.

## What Makes It Different

Finnish makaronilaatikko uses **egg-milk custard binding**, not a cheese sauce. This creates a completely different texture and flavor profile from American or British versions.

## Ingredients

### Casserole
- 350g elbow macaroni
- 400g ground beef
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 600ml whole milk
- 3 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon nutmeg (signature spice)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- White pepper to taste
- Butter for the dish

### Traditional Accompaniments
- Ketchup (mandatory)
- Lingonberry jam (lingonsylt)
- Pickled beetroot

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven** to 400°F (200°C).

2. **Cook pasta**: Boil macaroni until just al dente. Drain.

3. **Brown beef**: Cook ground beef with onion until no longer pink. Season lightly.

4. **Make custard**: Whisk together milk, eggs, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.

5. **Combine**: In a buttered baking dish, mix pasta and beef.

6. **Add custard**: Pour egg-milk mixture over pasta.

7. **Bake**: 35-45 minutes until golden and set.

8. **Serve**: With ketchup, lingonberry jam, and pickled beetroot.

## The Custard vs. Cheese Difference

| Finnish (Custard) | American (Cheese) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Egg-milk binding | Cheese sauce |
| Subtle, savory | Rich, cheesy |
| Lighter texture | Heavier, creamier |
| Nutmeg forward | Cheese forward |

## Why Ketchup?

To foreigners, the ketchup requirement seems odd. To Finns, makaronilaatikko without ketchup is incomplete. The sweet-tangy condiment balances the savory custard perfectly.

## History

Originally a meatless Christmas Eve dish (Catholic tradition of abstaining from meat). The ground beef was added later as meat became more accessible, transforming it into everyday fare.

## Make-Ahead

- Mix pasta and beef, refrigerate overnight
- Add custard and bake the next day
- Leftovers reheat well

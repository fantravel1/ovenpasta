quick_answer: "Always undercook pasta by 2 minutes when baking—it continues cooking in the oven. Never add oil to pasta water (sauce won't adhere), and save the starchy cooking water to adjust sauce consistency."

## The Golden Rules

### 1. Undercook by 2 Minutes
Pasta continues cooking in the oven. If you cook it fully before baking, you'll end up with mushy results.

- **Package says 10 minutes?** Cook for 8
- **Package says 12 minutes?** Cook for 10
- Test early—better too firm than too soft

### 2. Never Add Oil to Pasta Water
This is a common mistake. Oil creates a slippery coating that prevents sauce from adhering to pasta.

**Exception**: Toss with a tiny bit of oil ONLY if you must hold pasta before saucing (not ideal).

### 3. Salt the Water Generously
"Like the sea" is the Italian standard. Pasta absorbs seasoning while cooking—this is your only chance to season from within.

- **Ratio**: 1 tablespoon salt per liter of water
- Unsalted pasta tastes flat no matter how good your sauce

### 4. Save the Pasta Water
That starchy water is liquid gold:
- Helps bind sauces
- Adjusts consistency
- Contains salt for seasoning
- Reserve at least 1 cup before draining

## Pasta Shapes for Baking

### Best Sauce-Catchers
| Shape | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| Rigatoni | Hearty meat sauces |
| Penne | All-purpose baking |
| Ziti | Classic baked ziti |
| Shells | Cheese sauces, stuffing |
| Bucatini | Pastitsio, thick sauces |
| Macaroni | Mac and cheese, casseroles |

### Shapes to Avoid
- **Angel hair**: Too delicate, becomes mushy
- **Orzo**: Absorbs too much liquid (except giouvetsi)
- **Fresh pasta**: Cooks too quickly (except lasagna sheets)

## The Sauce Ratio

Baked pasta needs MORE sauce than stovetop pasta:
- **Stovetop**: Just enough to coat
- **Baked**: Pasta should swim slightly

### Why More Sauce?
1. Pasta absorbs liquid in the oven
2. Evaporation occurs during baking
3. Too little sauce = dry, disappointing results

**Rule of thumb**: If it looks like enough sauce, add a bit more.

## Cooling and Holding

If you must hold pasta before assembling:
1. Spread on a sheet pan (don't pile)
2. Toss with a tiny amount of sauce (not oil)
3. Cover with plastic wrap
4. Use within 1 hour

## Regional Pasta Cooking Styles

### Italian (Al Dente)
- Firm to the bite
- Slight resistance when chewed
- The standard for baking

### American (Southern Mac)
- Cook 2 minutes LONGER than al dente
- Softer pasta absorbs less liquid
- Results in creamier casserole

### Greek/Middle Eastern
- Similar to Italian al dente
- Pasta should hold structure through long baking

## Common Mistakes

### Rinsing Pasta
**Never rinse** pasta for baked dishes:
- Removes starch needed for sauce adhesion
- Cools pasta (sauce won't absorb properly)
- Washes away salt

**Only exception**: Cold pasta salads

### Overcrowding the Pot
Pasta needs room to move:
- Use largest pot available
- Lots of water = stable temperature
- Stir immediately after adding pasta
- Stir occasionally during cooking

### Not Stirring Initially
First 2 minutes are critical:
- Pasta is most likely to stick when starch releases
- Stir frequently at the start
- Use a fork for long pasta, spoon for short

## Testing for Doneness

### The Bite Test
1. Remove one piece of pasta
2. Bite through the center
3. Look for a thin white line (uncooked core)
4. For baking: That white line should be visible

### The Bend Test (Long Pasta)
1. Hold a strand at both ends
2. Bend gently
3. Should flex without breaking
4. For baking: Slightly stiffer than normal al dente

## Timing Your Assembly

For best results, assemble baked pasta immediately after cooking:
1. Hot pasta absorbs sauce better
2. Cheese melts into warm pasta
3. Less likely to clump or stick

If not baking immediately, assemble anyway—refrigerate the whole dish.

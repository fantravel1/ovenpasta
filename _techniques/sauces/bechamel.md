quick_answer: "Béchamel is made with equal parts butter and flour (roux) whisked with warm milk. The universal ratio is 50g butter : 50g flour : 1 liter milk. Add milk gradually while whisking constantly to prevent lumps."

## The Universal Béchamel Ratio

**50g butter : 50g flour : 1 liter milk**

This ratio produces a medium-thick sauce perfect for most baked pasta dishes. Adjust thickness by:
- **Thinner sauce**: Use 40g each butter/flour
- **Thicker sauce**: Use 60g each butter/flour

## Step-by-Step Method

### 1. Make the Roux
1. Melt butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat
2. Add flour all at once and whisk immediately
3. Cook for 2 minutes, whisking constantly—this removes raw flour taste
4. **Don't let it brown** for white béchamel

### 2. Add the Milk
1. **Warm your milk first**—this prevents lumps and speeds cooking
2. Remove pan from heat momentarily
3. Add about ¼ of the milk, whisking vigorously
4. Return to heat and continue whisking until smooth
5. Add remaining milk gradually, whisking constantly

### 3. Cook to Proper Consistency
1. Bring to a gentle simmer, stirring frequently
2. Cook 8-10 minutes until sauce coats the back of a spoon
3. Run your finger through sauce on spoon—it should leave a clear trail

### 4. Season
- **Salt**: Essential—unseasoned béchamel tastes flat
- **White pepper**: Traditional (doesn't show specks)
- **Nutmeg**: The classic aromatic—freshly grated is best

## Regional Variations

### French (Classic)
- Pure white sauce
- Nutmeg seasoning
- No cheese in the sauce itself

### Italian (Besciamella)
- Often includes Parmigiano-Reggiano
- Used in lasagna Bolognese
- Sometimes bay leaf infused in milk

### Greek
- **Eggs added** for richness and structure
- Kefalotyri cheese mixed in
- Essential for pastitsio's firm top layer

### Egyptian
- Made with milk AND chicken broth
- Creates savory depth
- Traditional for macarona bechamel

## Troubleshooting

### Lumpy Sauce
- **Cause**: Cold milk added too quickly, or flour not fully incorporated
- **Fix**: Strain through fine-mesh sieve, or blend with immersion blender
- **Prevention**: Always warm milk; add gradually while whisking

### Too Thin
- **Fix**: Continue cooking to reduce, or make a small additional roux
- **Prevention**: Cook longer before adding next batch of milk

### Too Thick
- **Fix**: Whisk in more warm milk until desired consistency
- **Prevention**: Use proper ratio; remember sauce thickens as it cools

### Skin Forming
- **Fix**: Whisk to incorporate, or remove skin
- **Prevention**: Press plastic wrap directly onto surface, or dot with butter

## Science Notes

### Why Warm Milk?
Cold milk hitting hot roux creates temperature shock that causes flour proteins to clump before they can properly disperse.

### Why Equal Butter and Flour?
This ratio ensures enough fat to coat flour particles (preventing lumps) while providing enough starch for thickening.

### Why Cook the Roux?
Raw flour has a pasty, unpleasant taste. Cooking for 2 minutes eliminates this without browning.

## Make-Ahead Tips

- Béchamel can be made 2-3 days ahead
- Store with plastic wrap pressed directly on surface
- Reheat gently, whisking in a splash of milk if too thick
- Never freeze—texture becomes grainy

## Chef Tips

> "The secret to smooth béchamel is patience. Add milk slowly and never stop whisking." — Classic French technique

- Use a flat-bottomed whisk for better contact with pan
- A heavy pan prevents hot spots and scorching
- If adding cheese, remove from heat first to prevent curdling

quick_answer: "The ideal cheese melting temperature is 160-170°F (71-77°C). Remove sauce from heat before adding cheese to prevent curdling. Use freshly shredded cheese—pre-shredded contains anti-caking agents that affect melting."

## The Science of Melting

### What Happens When Cheese Melts

1. **Fat softens** (starts around 90°F/32°C)
2. **Proteins relax** (around 130°F/54°C)
3. **Cheese flows** (150-170°F/65-77°C)
4. **Fat separates** (over 180°F/82°C) — THIS IS BAD

### The Sweet Spot: 160-170°F (71-77°C)
At this temperature:
- Cheese is fully melted
- Proteins remain intact
- Fat stays emulsified
- Texture is smooth and stretchy

## Why Cheese Goes Wrong

### Grainy/Broken Sauce
**Cause**: Too much heat causing fat separation
**Fix**: Start over, or blend with immersion blender
**Prevention**:
- Add cheese OFF heat or on very low heat
- Never boil cheese sauce
- Stir constantly while adding

### Rubbery Cheese
**Cause**: Overheating causes proteins to tighten and squeeze out fat
**Fix**: Can't be fixed once rubbery
**Prevention**:
- Remove from oven before cheese fully browns
- Use lower oven temperature
- Add cheese in final minutes of baking

### Won't Melt Smoothly
**Cause**: Pre-shredded cheese with anti-caking agents
**Fix**: Switch to block cheese, shred yourself
**Prevention**: Always buy block cheese and shred fresh

## Cheese Selection Guide

### For Melting INTO Sauce
Best cheeses contain more fat and moisture:
- **Fontina**: Creamy, melts beautifully
- **Gruyère**: Nutty, smooth melt
- **Young Gouda**: Mild, excellent melter
- **American cheese**: Perfect emulsification (sodium citrate)

### For Topping (Browning)
Best cheeses have lower moisture:
- **Low-moisture mozzarella**: Classic stretch and browning
- **Provolone**: Good browning, mild flavor
- **Parmesan**: Crispy, umami-rich crust

### For Custard-Style Dishes
- **Sharp cheddar**: Flavor without excessive fat
- **Colby Jack**: Mild, good melt
- **Cream cheese**: Adds richness without graininess

## Regional Cheese Traditions

### Italian
- **Parmigiano-Reggiano**: Hard, aged, for flavor (not melting)
- **Mozzarella**: Fresh for moisture, low-moisture for browning
- **Pecorino Romano**: Sharp, salty, for Southern dishes

### Greek
- **Kefalotyri**: Hard, salty, similar to Pecorino
- **Feta**: Doesn't melt—softens and browns (see: TikTok pasta)
- **Kasseri**: Good melter for pastitsio

### American
- **Sharp cheddar**: The standard for mac and cheese
- **Velveeta/American**: Perfect emulsification
- **Monterey Jack**: Mild, great melter

## The Pre-Shredded Problem

Pre-shredded cheese contains:
- **Cellulose**: Prevents clumping, inhibits melting
- **Potato starch**: Absorbs moisture
- **Natamycin**: Prevents mold, affects texture

### The Result
- Doesn't melt as smoothly
- Can create grainy sauces
- Won't achieve same stretch

### The Solution
**Always shred fresh from a block**. Takes 2 extra minutes, makes enormous difference.

## Cheese Combinations

### Classic Three-Cheese Blend
1. **Melting cheese** (mozzarella, fontina): 50%
2. **Flavor cheese** (cheddar, Gruyère): 35%
3. **Finishing cheese** (Parmesan, Pecorino): 15%

### Southern Mac Blend
- Sharp cheddar: 40%
- Mild cheddar: 30%
- Cream cheese: 15%
- American cheese: 15%

### Italian Blend
- Low-moisture mozzarella: 60%
- Parmigiano-Reggiano: 30%
- Pecorino Romano: 10%

## Temperature Tips

### Adding Cheese to Sauce
1. Remove pot from heat
2. Let cool 1-2 minutes (to ~170°F)
3. Add cheese in batches, stirring between
4. Never return to high heat

### Room Temperature Matters
Cold cheese melts unevenly:
- Edges melt before center
- Can cause breaking
- **Solution**: Let cheese sit out 15-20 minutes before using

### Oven Temperatures
- **350°F/175°C**: Gentle browning, less risk of breaking
- **375°F/190°C**: Good browning, watch carefully
- **400°F+**: Quick browning, add cheese late in cooking

## Achieving the Perfect Top

### Golden and Bubbly
1. Use low-moisture mozzarella for stretch
2. Mix with Parmesan for browning
3. Bake covered, then uncover for final 10 minutes
4. Finish under broiler if needed (watch constantly)

### The Frico Effect
A crispy cheese crust forms when:
- Parmesan creates thin layer
- High heat renders fat
- Proteins crisp without burning
- Result: Crackling cheese topping

## Troubleshooting

### Cheese Pooled on Top (Didn't Spread)
- Shred finer next time
- Toss cheese with a bit of flour
- Ensure dish is hot when cheese is added

### Cheese Browned Too Fast
- Lower oven temperature
- Cover with foil
- Add cheese later in cooking
- Position rack lower in oven

### Cheese Didn't Brown
- Increase oven temperature for final minutes
- Use broiler briefly (watch closely)
- Ensure cheese isn't buried under sauce

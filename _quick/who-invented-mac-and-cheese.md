## The Short Answer

**James Hemings** introduced mac and cheese to America.

James Hemings was an enslaved African American chef who traveled to Paris with Thomas Jefferson (1784-1789), where he trained in French culinary arts. He brought back the technique for "macaroni pie"—pasta baked with cheese sauce.

## The Full Story

### James Hemings (1765-1801)

- Born into slavery at the Wayles plantation in Virginia
- Brother of Sally Hemings
- Accompanied Jefferson to France at age 19
- Trained under master French chefs in Paris
- Became one of the first Americans trained in French haute cuisine
- Negotiated his freedom in 1796

### The 1790 Dinner Table Bargain

On June 20, 1790, James Hemings prepared what may be America's most consequential dinner. Jefferson hosted Alexander Hamilton and James Madison at his New York residence, where they negotiated:
- The location of the nation's capital (Washington, D.C.)
- Federal assumption of state debts

**Macaroni pie was on the menu.**

### But Didn't Jefferson Invent It?

No. This is a common misconception. Jefferson:
- Popularized macaroni in America
- Brought back a pasta machine from Italy
- Served it at the White House
- But did NOT cook it himself

**James Hemings was the chef** who actually created and prepared the dishes.

## The European Origins

Mac and cheese has older roots:
- **14th century**: English cookbook "Forme of Cury" mentions "makerouns" with cheese
- **18th century**: French "macaroni au gratin" was fashionable
- **1769**: Elizabeth Raffald published a recipe in England

James Hemings adapted these European traditions and brought them to American tables.

## Why This History Matters

For decades, the story of American mac and cheese credited Jefferson while erasing Hemings. Recognizing James Hemings:
- Acknowledges the culinary contributions of enslaved people
- Corrects historical erasure
- Honors the true creator of an American icon

## The Evolution

After Hemings, mac and cheese evolved:
- **1937**: Kraft introduced boxed mac and cheese during the Depression
- **1950s-60s**: Became a TV dinner staple
- **Soul food tradition**: Southern Black families developed custard-based versions
- **Today**: Both comfort food and gourmet restaurant dish

## The Short Answer

**Johnny Marzetti** is a ground beef and macaroni casserole topped with cheddar cheese, created in Columbus, Ohio in 1896. It's named after the brother-in-law of its creator, Teresa Marzetti.

## What's In It?

### Classic Johnny Marzetti
- Ground beef
- Elbow macaroni
- Tomato sauce (not marinara—simpler)

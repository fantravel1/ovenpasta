quick_answer: "NO. Authentic Lasagna Bolognese uses béchamel sauce, NOT ricotta. Ricotta is used in Southern Italian lasagnas (like Lasagna Napoletana), but the official recipe registered by the Accademia Italiana della Cucina specifically requires béchamel."

## The Short Answer

**No, authentic Lasagna Bolognese does NOT contain ricotta.**

The official recipe, registered with the Bologna Chamber of Commerce by the Accademia Italiana della Cucina, specifically requires:
- Béchamel sauce (besciamella)
- Ragù Bolognese
- Fresh spinach pasta (sfoglia verde)
- Parmigiano-Reggiano

## Why the Confusion?

### Regional Differences

Italy has many regional lasagna traditions:

| Region | Lasagna Style | Uses Ricotta? |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Emilia-Romagna | Lasagna Bolognese | ❌ No - Béchamel |
| Campania | Lasagna Napoletana | ✅ Yes |
| Sicily | Pasta 'Ncasciata | ✅ Yes |
| Calabria | Sagne Chine | ❌ No - Cheese layers |

### The American Adaptation

When Italian immigrants (primarily from Southern Italy) came to America, they brought their ricotta-based lasagna traditions. This became the "standard" American lasagna, which most Americans assume is authentic to all of Italy.

## The Official Requirements

According to the Accademia Italiana della Cucina's registered recipe (updated April 20, 2023):

1. **Must use béchamel** (NOT ricotta)
2. **No mozzarella** (only Parmigiano-Reggiano)
3. **Green spinach pasta** (fresh, thin sheets)
4. **Minimum 6 layers** with light application of each component
5. **Slow-cooked ragù** (2-3+ hours with milk added in final 30 minutes)

## So When IS Ricotta Correct?

Ricotta is authentic and traditional in:
- **Lasagna Napoletana** (Naples) - Uses ricotta, meatballs, hard-boiled eggs
- **Lasagna di Carnevale** - Carnival lasagna with ricotta
- **American-Italian Lasagna** - A legitimate cuisine in its own right

## The Bottom Line

If you're making Lasagna Bolognese and want to be authentic: **use béchamel**.

If you prefer ricotta: that's a different (equally delicious) tradition from Southern Italy and Italian-American cooking.

Both are "correct"—they're just different regional dishes.

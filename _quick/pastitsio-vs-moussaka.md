## The Quick Comparison

| Feature | Pastitsio | Moussaka |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Base** | Pasta (bucatini) | Eggplant + potatoes |
| **Meat** | Ground beef | Ground beef or lamb |
| **Spices** | Cinnamon, allspice | Cinnamon, allspice |
| **Top** | Egg-enriched béchamel | Egg-enriched béchamel |
| **Origin** | Italian "pasticcio" | Ottoman/Turkish |
| **Texture** | Firm, sliceable | Soft, layered |

## The Base: The Key Difference

### Pastitsio
- Uses **bucatini** (thick hollow spaghetti) or "Pastitsio No. 2" pasta
- Pasta is mixed with egg and cheese before layering
- Creates a firm, sliceable structure

### Moussaka
- Uses **fried eggplant slices** (and sometimes potatoes)
- Vegetables are layered, not mixed
- Softer, more yielding texture

## What They Share

Both dishes feature the distinctly **Greek flavor profile**:
- **Cinnamon** in the meat sauce (non-negotiable)
- **Allspice** for warmth
- **Nutmeg** in the béchamel
- **Egg-enriched béchamel** (richer than French version)
- Red wine in the meat sauce

## The Béchamel Difference

Greek béchamel is NOT the same as French:
- Contains **eggs** (usually just yolks)
- Often includes **cheese** (kefalotyri or Parmesan)
- Creates a **firmer top** that holds its shape when sliced
- Ratio: Standard béchamel + 2-3 egg yolks per liter of milk

## Which Came First?

### Pastitsio
- Name from Italian "pasticcio" (pie/mess)
- Modernized by **Nikolaos Tselementes** (Greek chef trained in France) around 1910
- Earlier Greek versions included liver and phyllo wrapping

### Moussaka
- Name from Arabic "musaqqa'a" (chilled)
- Ottoman/Turkish origins
- Also standardized by Tselementes with French béchamel topping

## The Greek Vote

In popularity polls among Greeks:
- **Moussaka**: 65%
- **Pastitsio**: 35%

But many Greek families are fiercely loyal to one or the other—it's a passionate debate!

## When to Serve Each

### Pastitsio
- Sunday family lunch
- Easier to transport (firmer structure)
- Better for feeding crowds
- Reheats exceptionally well

### Moussaka
- Special occasions
- Summer (when eggplant is in season)
- More impressive presentation
- Considered slightly more refined

## The Resting Rule

Both dishes **MUST rest** before cutting:
- Minimum 15-20 minutes
- Allows layers to set
- Many Greeks insist both taste better the next day

## Can't Decide? Try the Fusion

**Pastitsio with Eggplant** combines both traditions—pasta layers with roasted eggplant added to the meat layer. Best of both worlds!

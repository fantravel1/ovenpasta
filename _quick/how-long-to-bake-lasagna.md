question: "How long should you bake lasagna?"
quick_answer: "Bake lasagna at 375°F (190°C) for 45-60 minutes covered with foil, then remove foil and bake 10-15 minutes more until golden and bubbling. Let rest 15-20 minutes before cutting for clean slices."

## The Complete Timing Guide

### Standard Lasagna (Room Temperature)

| Stage | Temperature | Time |
|-------|------------|------|
| Covered | 375°F (190°C) | 45-60 min |
| Uncovered | 375°F (190°C) | 10-15 min |
| Resting | Room temp | 15-20 min |
| **Total** | | **70-95 min** |

### Cold from Refrigerator

Add 15-20 minutes to the covered baking time. Start at 350°F for the first 20 minutes to prevent temperature shock, then increase to 375°F.

### Frozen Lasagna

| Method | Temperature | Time |
|--------|------------|------|
| Direct from freezer | 375°F | 90 min covered + 15 min uncovered |
| Thawed overnight | 375°F | Standard timing |

## Why Cover Then Uncover?

**Covered phase**: Creates steam that cooks the interior without drying the top. The foil traps moisture, ensuring pasta and cheese layers heat through evenly.

**Uncovered phase**: Allows the top to brown and develop that irresistible golden, bubbling crust.

## The Resting Period is Non-Negotiable

Those 15-20 minutes aren't just for cooling—they're essential for:

- **Carryover cooking** — Internal temp rises 5-10°F
- **Starches setting** — Layers firm up
- **Cheese firming** — Creates clean, sliceable portions

Cut too soon and you'll have lasagna soup. Cut after resting and you'll have Instagram-worthy layers.

## How to Tell It's Done

1. **Internal temperature**: 165°F (74°C) in the center
2. **Bubbling**: Sauce should bubble around edges AND in center
3. **Golden top**: Cheese should be golden brown, not just melted
4. **Pull-away**: Edges should slightly pull away from pan

## Altitude Adjustments

Above 5,000 feet:
- Add 10-15 minutes to baking time
- Reduce oven temperature by 25°F
- Watch for faster browning

## Convection Oven

If using convection:
- Reduce temperature by 25°F (to 350°F)
- Reduce time by about 15%
- Watch the top—it browns faster
